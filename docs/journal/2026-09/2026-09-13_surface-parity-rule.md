# A surface-parity rule for `--stylo-*` tokens

Reviewing
[the preview typography + code-highlighting request](../../requests/2026-09-13_preview-typography-and-code-highlighting.md)
turned up two tokens — `--stylo-font-size` and the eleven `--stylo-syntax-*`
tokens — that the in-place canvas has read since they were introduced, and
`preview` never has. Tracing why landed on
[ADR-002 §3](../2026-09-01_adr-002-editor-ux-and-customization.md)'s
tenth-token amendment, which claims `--stylo-font-size` "backs that rule on
every surface." It doesn't, and never did — only `.cm-editor` reads it. The
claim just went unchecked.

## What was already true

Grepping every `--stylo-*` name against `stylo.module.css` first, so the fix
below starts from a complete list rather than another partial one:

- **Already shared, correctly:** `--stylo-bg`, `--stylo-text`,
  `--stylo-text-muted`, `--stylo-border`, `--stylo-link`, `--stylo-radius`,
  `--stylo-font-family-mono`, and the three `--stylo-table-*` tokens.
- **Correctly in-place-only** (preview has no equivalent concept, so it isn't
  a gap): `--stylo-ring` (a focus outline; preview isn't focusable),
  `--stylo-surface-floating` (floating popups; preview has none),
  `--stylo-guide` (CodeMirror's list-indent-guide rail; preview's nested lists
  render as literal nested `<ul>`/`<ol>`, no rail needed), and
  `--stylo-accent` (toolbar active-state; preview has no toolbar).
- **Actually missing, both silently:** `--stylo-font-size` and every
  `--stylo-syntax-*` token.

Two real gaps, not eleven — but two more than a document that says "every
surface" should have.

## The rule

Formalized as a dated amendment to
[ADR-002 §3](../2026-09-01_adr-002-editor-ux-and-customization.md): the
in-place canvas stays the reference surface a new token is introduced
against — that was already every amendment's actual practice — but a token's
reach onto `preview` (and `split`, which is just `source` + `preview` side by
side) now has to be **decided and written down in the same change**. "Not
applicable" is a fine answer when preview has nothing analogous; silence
isn't, because silence is what let `--stylo-font-size` sit half-wired with no
one noticing until a host toggled modes on the same document and watched it
visibly drift.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` carries the same rule as a checklist line, so it's checked
before a token ships, not rediscovered after.

## Closing the two gaps

Both landed in the same change, as the rule's first application
(ADR-002 §3's second 2026-09-13 amendment):

- `.preview`'s base `font-size` (`stylo.module.css`) is now
  `var(--stylo-font-size, 0.9375rem)` instead of a literal `0.9375rem`. Every
  descendant rule in the scale was already `em`-based off that one value, so
  nothing else needed changing; `padding` moved from a fixed `rem` to a
  matching `em` value so it tracks the base size too instead of going
  oversized against a smaller host-set one.
- Fenced code in `preview` now highlights. `src/editor/highlight.ts` gained
  `SYNTAX_TAG_GROUPS`, the shared tag → token list `styloHighlightStyle` (the
  live CodeMirror extension) now builds from. A new
  `src/render/highlightCode.ts` resolves a fence's language through the exact
  rules `@codemirror/lang-markdown` uses for `codeLanguages`, parses the block
  once with the resolved grammar, and walks it with `@lezer/highlight`'s
  `highlightTree` against that same `SYNTAX_TAG_GROUPS` list — outside of any
  `EditorView`, since `preview` has none — emitting `stylo-tok-<token>` spans
  that `stylo.module.css` colours with the same `--stylo-syntax-*` tokens. A
  new `src/render/CodeBlock.tsx` renders plain text immediately and swaps in
  the coloured spans once that resolves, so there's no loading flash. Both
  `@lezer/highlight` and `@codemirror/language` are peer dependencies already
  (for the CodeMirror surfaces), so this shipped with no new dependency.
  `codeLanguages` is unchanged in every other respect: still opt-in, still
  read once at mount on the CodeMirror surfaces, still exactly as lazy
  per-language.

## Not automated

The both-blocks light/dark rule has a CI guard (`check:theme`) because it's a
mechanical check — every colour name in one block, cross-referenced against
the other. Surface parity isn't mechanical the same way: it needs a human
judgment call about which surfaces a token's _role_ applies to, not a name
match. Left as a documentation discipline for now, with an explicit revisit
trigger if it fails a third time.

## Verification

- `npm run format:check`, `npm run check:theme`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run build` — clean. The shared `SYNTAX_TAG_GROUPS` module now lands in
  its own chunk (`highlight-*.js`, ~1.1 kB gzip, shared by the in-place canvas
  and `preview`); added a matching entry to
  `scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs`, which otherwise fails on any unbudgeted
  chunk.
- `npm run check:size`, `npm run check:package` — clean.
- `npm run test` — 455 passing (was 359 at the last count in this file's
  neighbourhood, plus everything shipped since); five new in
  `test/preview-code-highlight.test.tsx` covering: fenced code with no
  `codeLanguages` stays plain, a resolved language colours its tokens, an
  unresolvable language name falls back to plain text, the function form of
  `codeLanguages` is called with the fence's language name, and inline code is
  never routed through the highlighter.
