# Closing the drift between two independently-authored implementations

A request arrived (via Sympose, but framed here as a general library
concern — see the note on that below) arguing that `preview` and the
in-place canvas are "two independently-authored style implementations that
happen to agree sometimes," and that patching each newly-discovered gap from
outside is whack-a-mole: nothing stops a new one appearing, because nothing
ever required the two to produce the same output in the first place.

## Verifying the claims first

Five concrete divergences were listed as "confirmed from stylo's own
source." Each was independently re-checked against the actual code before
any of this was touched, the same discipline that caught the earlier
`preview-full-parity-with-in-place` request's wrong premise:

- **h5/h6 heading size** — confirmed. `stylo.module.css`'s
  `.preview :is(h4, h5, h6)` rule set `margin`/`line-height` but never
  `font-size`; h5/h6 silently fell back to the browser's UA default instead
  of matching the in-place canvas's `0.9em`.
- **List-item spacing** — confirmed structural. Preview's `<li>` carries a
  real margin; the in-place canvas, a flat text surface, had no equivalent
  concept at all.
- **Callout padding/radius** — confirmed. Preview: `padding: 0.6em 1em`, all
  four corners rounded. In-place: `paddingTop`/`paddingBottom: 0.7em`, only
  the right corners rounded (built from stacked lines with a `border-left`
  accent, so the left corner has no box to round).
- **Table width** — did **not** check out. The request claimed in-place
  forces `width: 100%` and preview doesn't. No such rule exists anywhere in
  the in-place theme files; a live Playwright measurement confirmed the
  in-place table renders shrink-to-fit (180px inside a 718px-wide editor),
  identical to preview. Both surfaces already agree here — no fix applied,
  and the claim is noted as inaccurate rather than acted on.
- **Vertical rhythm before a block** — confirmed, and flagged by the request
  itself as the one gap no host-side CSS can close: preview uses a fixed
  `margin-top` per construct; the in-place canvas uses a smaller
  `paddingTop`, sized on the assumption that a blank source line usually
  supplies the rest of the gap. When that assumption doesn't hold — a
  heading with no blank line before it — the in-place gap collapses to just
  the padding while preview's stays fixed. Left open; see below.

## What shipped

The request explicitly argued _against_ growing the public token surface as
the fix — "more surface to override doesn't fix two independently-authored
implementations, it just gives hosts a bigger version of the same
whack-a-mole" — and asked instead for one shared values source inside
stylo. That's what this ships: six new **internal** custom properties in
`tokens.css` (`--stylo-rhythm-h1-size` … `-h6-line`,
`--stylo-rhythm-list-item-gap[-nested]`, `--stylo-rhythm-callout-padding-x`/
`-y`), read by both `inplace/theme-canvas.ts` / `theme-callout.ts` and
`stylo.module.css` instead of each hard-coding its own number.

Deliberately **not** added to the public "Styling tokens" table in
`props.md` — ADR-002 has a standing rule against growing that surface
without a real host-facing role ("one token per real role, no shadcn-style
sprawl"), and this fix is about internal sharing, not giving hosts a new
override point. A host restyling rhythm still targets the resulting CSS
classes directly, exactly as before.

Concretely:

- `preview`'s `h4`/`h5`/`h6` each get an explicit `font-size` now (previously
  only `h1`–`h3` did); `h1`–`h6` and the in-place canvas's `.cm-inplace-h1`–
  `h6` read the same six size/line-height tokens.
- `preview`'s `.stylo-callout` padding and corner-rounding now match
  in-place's: `0.7em` vertical (was `0.6em`), and only the right corners
  round (was all four) — matching in-place's shape rather than in-place
  growing a fourth rounded corner it structurally can't draw.
- The in-place canvas gains list-item spacing for the first time:
  `list-guides.ts`'s existing per-`ListItem` walk (previously only for
  nesting indent guides) now also gives every item but the first in its own
  list a `cm-inplace-item-gap` line class (`paddingTop`, from the shared
  token) — the first item of a _nested_ list gets the larger
  `cm-inplace-item-gap-nested` instead, approximating preview's
  `li > :is(ul, ol)` margin on the sublist as a whole. This is a
  translation of preview's box-margin behaviour onto a flat-line canvas, not
  a bit-for-bit copy of its mechanics — a nested item's own gap in preview
  comes from CSS margin collapsing between boxes that don't exist here.

## A naming collision, caught by the existing test suite

The first attempt named the new classes `cm-inplace-li-gap` /
`cm-inplace-li-gap-nested`. `test/inplace.test.tsx`'s `hasClass` helper does
a substring match, and `"cm-inplace-li-gap".includes("cm-inplace-li")` is
true — the existing "a flat list gets no `cm-inplace-li` decoration" test
failed the moment the new classes existed, because it was actually seeing
the new gap class, not the indent-guide one. Renamed to `cm-inplace-item-gap`
(no `cm-inplace-li` substring at all) rather than fixing the shared test
helper — the substring-match convention already relies on prefix
disambiguation elsewhere in the codebase (`cm-inplace-table` /
`cm-inplace-table-edit`), so a new name avoiding the collision is the
narrower fix.

## Verification

- `npm run format`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run check:theme`,
  `npm run build`, `npm run check:size`, `npm run check:package` — clean.
  `InPlaceView` stayed at 22,111 B gzip, unchanged against its 23,000 B
  budget.
- `npm run test` — 461 passing, including a new case asserting the exact
  gap-class pattern across a flat item, a nested-list's first item, and a
  nested-list's second item.
- Two new permanent Playwright specs (`test/browser/rhythm.spec.ts`) load
  the in-place canvas and (via `split` mode's live-updating preview pane)
  preview with the same pasted document, and assert their **computed**
  values match — not hard-coded numbers, so either surface drifting from the
  other fails the test regardless of which side moved. Heading sizes h1–h6
  and callout padding/corner-radius are covered this way; both passed
  post-fix, confirming the fix does what was intended in a real browser, not
  just in the CSS source.
- The same live-Chromium technique (paste via clipboard into `mode=in-place`
  and separately into `mode=split`'s source pane, then read
  `getComputedStyle`) was used ad hoc first to confirm every numeric claim
  above, including disproving the table-width one, before any code changed.

## What's still open

The vertical-rhythm-before-a-block gap is unresolved. The request's own
framing is correct: no shared token fixes it, because the in-place canvas's
current gap is a function of how many blank lines the document happens to
contain, and preview's isn't. Closing it means collapsing blank-line runs
into a fixed decorative gap (matching preview's margin) with the underlying
blank lines revealed at normal height only while the caret is near them —
the same reveal-on-caret-entry pattern already used for headings, math, and
tables. Agreed as the direction, not yet built: it changes the visual
spacing of every existing in-place document and needs its own scoped
change, tracked separately.

## A framing note

This request was relayed through Sympose, the app it was found in — but per
a standing project practice, it's treated as a general Stylo capability
gap, not a Sympose-specific one throughout: every fix above benefits any
consumer rendering both `in-place` and `preview` for the same document, and
nothing here is Sympose-specific.
