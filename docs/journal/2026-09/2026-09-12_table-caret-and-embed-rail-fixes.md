# Two caret/layout bugs after a table and an embed

A user report — "caret positioning is off after a table" in the playground —
traced to two separate, previously undocumented bugs in the in-place canvas.
Neither is new; both predate this session's other work, surfaced now because
the report happened to land right after it.

## 1. `EditableTableWidget.bounds()` disagreed with the real GFM parse

`src/inplace/table-widget.ts`'s `bounds()` re-derived the table's `[from, to]`
document range with its own heuristic: starting from `posAtDOM`, it grew the
span across contiguous lines that were non-blank **and contained a `|`**. That
independently reinvented what `src/inplace/tables.ts`'s `tableField` already
gets for free from the syntax tree (`node.from` / `node.to` on the Lezer
`Table` node) — and the two disagreed whenever a table was followed, with no
blank line, by a plain-prose line containing no `|`.

GFM's own table parser (`@lezer/markdown`'s `TableParser.nextLine`) doesn't
check for a pipe on continuation lines — it swallows _any_ non-blank line
after the header + delimiter into the same `Table` node, until a blank line
or a new block-starting construct interrupts it. That's real GFM behaviour
(the same reason every Markdown guide says "always blank-line after a
table"), and `tableField`'s decoration — the thing `EditorView.atomicRanges`
actually enforces — correctly reflects it. `bounds()`'s pipe-only scan
stopped one line short.

Consequence: `exitBelow()` / `exitAbove()` (used by ArrowUp/Down/Tab/Enter out
of the last cell) computed a caret position using the short range, landing
inside what CodeMirror still considered the atomic table — the caret
appeared to not move, or moved somewhere unexpected. `sync()`'s reserialize
dispatch used the same short range, so it never touched the swallowed line
either.

**Fix:** `bounds()` now reads `tableField` directly —
`view.state.field(tableField).between(pos, pos, ...)` — the same source
`src/inplace/table-enter.ts`'s `arrowIntoTable` already used correctly for
keyboard _entry_. One source of truth for the table's range, not two.
`test/table-interactive.test.tsx` gained a regression test: a table
immediately followed by a pipe-less line, arrowing out of the true last
(swallowed) row now lands at the genuine document end, not one line short of
it.

## 2. `.cm-inplace-embed`'s box model

Two issues here.

**The margin-collapse one.** `.cm-inplace-embed .stylo-embed-content` wraps
whatever `embedSource` returns, with no vertical padding/border of its own.
A host node with its own `margin-top` / `margin-bottom` (a self-styled card)
collapsed straight through it, so the border-left accent rail — drawn at
`.stylo-embed-content`'s own box edge — ended up not matching where the card
actually rendered (visually, the rail sitting apart from / shorter than the
card). `preview`'s stylesheet already guards against exactly this
(`stylo.module.css`: `.stylo-embed-content > :first-child { margin-top: 0 }`
/ `:last-child { margin-bottom: 0 }`) — the in-place canvas theme just never
got the same rule when embeds landed there. Added the equivalent to
`theme-canvas.ts`.

**The margin-vs-padding one — this was the actual reported bug.** Every
other block widget's vertical spacing in `theme-canvas.ts` is `padding`, not
`margin`, specifically because margin sits outside the border box CodeMirror's
height map measures and drifts click-to-position for everything below (the
2026-09-02 click-mapping fix). `.cm-inplace-embed` never got that treatment.
A first pass here tried the same `padding` swap, confirmed it fixed nothing
reproducible in a short single-viewport test fixture, and reverted it after
finding it broke something else (below) — but the user then confirmed
directly against their real content (`![[Getting Started]]` and
`![[architecture/diagram.png|320]]` in `playground/content/sample.md`):
removing the two embeds made the caret bug disappear. That's a real repro
this session's fixture didn't reach (likely needs the longer, scrolled
document the original 2026-09-02 bug's own description implies), and it
settles the "unconfirmed" question — the margin was the cause.

**Why the first attempt at `padding` broke interactive content.** Converting
`.cm-inplace-embed` to `padding` also broke
`test/browser/embed.spec.ts`'s "interactive host content keeps its own
clicks" — a click on e.g. a button inside a resolved embed stopped reaching
the button and instead collapsed the embed to raw `![[ref]]` source. Root
cause, found by reading `@codemirror/view`'s own dispatch loop
(`runHandlers`): a custom `EditorView.domEventHandlers` hook returning
`false` (as `extension.ts`'s mousedown handler does for
`.closest(".stylo-embed-content")`) only means "not handled by _this_
handler" — it does not stop CodeMirror's own **built-in** mousedown handler
(registered in the same list) from _also_ running its default
click-to-place-caret logic, which resolves inside the atomic embed range
regardless. The margin-vs-padding difference happened to tip that default
handling's coordinate resolution across a threshold in the old fixture, but
the `.closest()`-and-bail approach was never a sound way to protect
interactive content — just one that happened not to visibly fail before.

**Real fix:** `Embed.tsx` now stops mousedown propagation on
`.stylo-embed-content` itself (`onMouseDown={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}`),
the exact technique `table-widget.ts` already uses for the identical
problem — stopping the event before it ever reaches CodeMirror's listener,
rather than hoping a handler further down the list declines to act on it.
Not `preventDefault`, so native focus/click on the host's own content still
works normally. With that in place, `.cm-inplace-embed` takes `padding` like
every other block, and both the click-mapping fix and the interactive-click
test pass together.

## Verification

`typecheck`, 442 Vitest tests (one new, table-widget), 27 Playwright browser
tests (one new, embed click-mapping sanity check — all passing, including
"interactive host content keeps its own clicks" with the `padding` change
now in place), `build`, and `format:check` all pass.
