# A browser test harness — Playwright over the in-place canvas

## Context

The in-place canvas is the part of Stylo that jsdom cannot test. Its behaviour is
layout and pointer interaction: markers reveal when the caret enters a line,
click-to-position runs through `coordsAtPos`, the selection bar and the
right-click menu are `position: fixed` popups that clamp to the viewport, and the
sticky toolbar holds its place through a `requestAnimationFrame` watchdog because
iOS Safari would otherwise drop it on scroll. jsdom gives every element a zero
box, so none of that can be asserted there.

The cost showed in the journal: the sticky-toolbar fix went through
`translateZ(0)`, then `position: sticky`, then the rAF watchdog, each verified by
hand in real Chrome; the token-decoupling and font work each closed with a note
that the visuals "still want a real-Chrome look." The standing rule became
_reproduce in a browser before claiming a fix_ — a rule with no automation behind
it.

## Decision

Add [`@playwright/test`](https://playwright.dev) as a dev dependency and a
`test/browser/` suite, run with `npm run test:browser` and in its own CI job.

- **Playwright, not Vitest browser mode.** The hard cases here are real
  right-click, real caret movement, and the rAF watchdog under a genuine scroll —
  Playwright's model fits them, and it is what the manual verification already
  used. The Vitest + jsdom suite stays the fast first line of defence; the two
  never overlap (`*.spec.ts` vs `*.test.ts`, and `test/browser/**` is excluded
  from the Vitest config).
- **A dedicated fixture, not the playground.** [`playground/fixture.html`](../../playground/fixture.html)
  is a bare `<Stylo>` mount whose entire config comes from URL query params
  (`?mode=…&selectionUI=bar&reveal=caret&sticky=top&doc=long`). Deterministic, no
  control-panel chrome, and it rides the existing Vite dev server — no second
  build setup. Playwright's `webServer` runs `npm run dev -- --port 5199
--strictPort` and reuses a server already up outside CI.
- **CI now.** A `browser` job installs Chromium (`--with-deps`) and runs the
  suite. A harness that isn't gated rots.

## What the first cut covers

Eleven tests across five files, aimed at what has actually broken:

- `reveal="caret"` marker reveal — the `# ` on a heading is a replace-widget with
  the caret elsewhere and editable text with the caret on the line.
- Heading renders visibly larger than body text (computed `font-size`).
- Selection bar (`selectionUI="bar"`) appears on a selection, stays on-screen,
  and **yields while the right-click menu is open** — the coordination added in
  the font-size / menu pass, which jsdom could only check at the state-field
  level.
- Right-click menu opens, clamps inside the viewport near an edge, dismisses on
  an outside click.
- Sticky toolbar stays at `y ≈ 0` through a 1500px window scroll.
- KaTeX renders with real dimensions in `preview` and on the in-place canvas.

## Consequences

- New dev dependency and a Chromium download in CI (~1–2 min, cached). Never
  ships — Playwright is test infra, absent from `dist/` and `package.json`
  `dependencies`.
- Contributors touching layout or pointer/caret code are expected to extend this
  suite; `CONTRIBUTING.md` says so.
- Follow-ups: table-cell editing interactions, touch (`pointer: coarse`)
  emulation for the long-press menu, and a visual-regression pass once the layout
  stops moving.
