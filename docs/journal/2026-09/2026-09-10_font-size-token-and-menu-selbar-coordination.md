# A font-size token, and the selection bar yielding to the right-click menu

Two small gaps closed in one pass. Both came from an editor integration that had
to reach past the public `--stylo-*` contract into undocumented internal class
names to get the behaviour it wanted.

## `.cm-editor` hard-coded its font size

The base CodeMirror theme set `font-size: 0.9375rem` directly on `.cm-editor`
(`src/editor/theme.ts`). A host wanting the editor to sit at its own type scale
had no token for it and was left overriding `.cm-editor` itself.

A tenth design token, **`--stylo-font-size`** (default `0.9375rem`), now backs
that rule: `fontSize: "var(--stylo-font-size, 0.9375rem)"`. The base theme feeds
`.cm-editor` on every surface — `source`, the `split` source pane, and the
in-place canvas — and every relative size on the in-place canvas is expressed in
`em`, so the whole surface scales from this one value.

Like `--stylo-radius`, it is not a colour: one value serves both themes, so it
lives only in the light block of `tokens.css` and `check:theme` (which pairs
colours across the light and dark blocks) ignores it.

## The selection bar and the right-click menu ignored each other

The in-place canvas has two floating popups — the selection bar that follows a
non-empty selection (`selectionUI: "bar"`) and the right-click / long-press
context menu. Both sit at `z-index: 20` and each was driven by its own
`ViewPlugin` with no reference to the other, so right-clicking while the
selection bar was up left the menu stacked on top of it.

Fix: a one-boolean state field, **`menuOpenField`** (`src/inplace/menu-open.ts`),
set through a `setMenuOpen` effect.

- `context-menu.ts`'s `createContextMenu` takes an optional `onOpenChange(open)`
  callback. It fires `true` from `show()` / `showField()` and `false` from
  `hide()` — the single dismissal choke point, so every path (outside press,
  Escape, scroll, action click) reports.
- `menu-plugin.ts` passes a callback that dispatches `setMenuOpen`. A `destroyed`
  guard covers teardown, where `menu.destroy()` calls `hide()` after the view may
  already be gone. The selection bar's own link/wikilink field menu and the
  editable-table structural menu are created without the callback, so only the
  right-click menu drives the signal.
- `selection-bar.ts` re-runs its measure when the field flips and returns "no
  bar" while it is set. The bar reappears on its own when the menu closes and the
  field clears — no extra bookkeeping.

## Verification

- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run check:theme`, `npm run check:size` — clean.
- `npm run test` — 359 passing (one added: a right-click sets `menuOpenField`
  and hides the bar, Escape clears it). jsdom cannot lay the bar out for a
  position assertion, so the test covers the state wiring; the measure
  early-return is a single read of that field.
