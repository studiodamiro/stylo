# `preview` table wrapper

## Context

Follow-on from `0.15.1` (`2026-09-13_inplace-table-gizmo-padding-shrinks-table.md`):
once the in-place table genuinely reached full width, the same "table isn't
full width" report kept recurring for `preview` — even though every earlier
live measurement of `preview`'s `<table>` element showed it exactly matching
its container's width. That measurement was true and also the wrong thing to
check: `Preview.tsx`'s module CSS set `table { display: block; margin: 2em 0;
border-collapse: collapse; overflow-x: auto }` directly on the `<table>`
element itself.

`display: block` on a `<table>` disables its native table-layout algorithm
entirely. The browser still renders the `<tr>`/`<td>` descendants as an
internal table-formatting box (their own default `display: table-row` /
`table-cell` survives), but that inner box now sizes itself to its own
content, completely independent of the outer block box's width. A `<table>`
element's `getBoundingClientRect()` still reports the _outer_ block box —
which genuinely does stretch to `width: 100%` — while the actual rendered
grid underneath doesn't move at all. Confirmed against a real measurement
from Sympose: the `<table>` element's own box matched its container exactly,
while its first `<tr>` measured 221px narrower — `getComputedStyle(table
).display` reported `"block"`, confirming the mechanism directly.

## Decision

Wrap the rendered `<table>` in `<div class="stylo-table-wrap">` (a new
`components.table` override in `Preview.tsx`) and move the block/scroll
behaviour onto that wrapper, leaving `<table>` at its native `display:
table`:

```css
.preview :global(.stylo-table-wrap) {
  display: block;
  margin: 2em 0;
  overflow-x: auto;
}
.preview table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
```

The same shape `0.15.1` already applied on the in-place side
(`.cm-inplace-table-wrap` carries the block/overflow behaviour;
`.cm-inplace-table` stays a real table) — `preview` was the _inverse_ of
that architecture until now: the block/overflow behaviour sat on the table
element itself, with no wrapper at all.

- **`.stylo-table-wrap` is a stable override point**, named to match
  `.cm-inplace-table-wrap` and stylo's existing plain-class convention
  (`.stylo-embed`, `.stylo-frontmatter`).
- Verified in a real Chromium (a standalone Playwright script against the
  dev server — jsdom does no CSS layout at all, so this specific bug is
  invisible to the unit suite by construction): with `table { width: 100%
!important }` applied the way Sympose's own override does, the table's
  computed `display` is now `"table"` and its rendered first row's width
  matches the table's own box within a border-collapse rounding pixel —
  previously a 221px-class gap. Also checked the default (no host override)
  case stays visually identical — the wrap fills its container the way any
  block box does, the table still sizes to its content inside it, same as
  before — and that an over-wide table still scrolls on the wrap rather than
  blowing out the container.

## Consequences

- Real visual fix for every `preview` consumer with a table narrower than
  its reading column — the table now actually stretches when a host sets
  `width: 100%` on it, or when the wrap itself is stretched.
- `test/preview.test.tsx` gained a structural check (table renders inside
  `.stylo-table-wrap`); `test/browser/preview-table.spec.ts` is new, covering
  the real-layout behaviour jsdom can't: a host's `width: 100%` reaching the
  actual grid, and an over-wide table still scrolling on the wrapper.
- Purely internal CSS plus one new stable class — no prop, no public API
  change. `in-place` and `source` are untouched.
