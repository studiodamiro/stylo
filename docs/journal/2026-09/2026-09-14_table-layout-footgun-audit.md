# Table-layout footgun audit

## Context

Two fixes landed back to back with the same root cause: a host tried to
resize a rendered surface (the in-place editable table in `0.15.1`, then
`preview`'s table in `0.15.2`) and the resize reached an outer box
disconnected from the actual visible content — an in-flow padding
reservation on one side, `display: block` silently disabling `<table>`'s own
layout algorithm on the other. Worth checking, rather than assuming, whether
this is a pattern recurring elsewhere in stylo's CSS before calling it closed.

## What was checked

Grepped both `src/styles/stylo.module.css` and every in-place `theme-*.ts`
file for the two shapes the table bugs actually took:

- **`display` overriding a native element's own specialised layout
  algorithm.** `<table>` is the only element stylo renders with a
  browser-native formatting context (the CSS table layout algorithm) whose
  internal box can detach from an ancestor's box the way this bug exploited.
  No other `display:` rule in the sheet touches a `table`/`tr`/`td` (only the
  one now-fixed `.preview table` rule, and the new `.stylo-table-wrap`); every
  other `display` override in the in-place theme files targets ordinary
  block/flex/inline elements with no such native algorithm to disconnect from.
- **Every other `overflow-x: auto` scroll wrapper in the sheet**
  (`.toolbarSticky`, `.preview pre`, inline code, `.katex-display`) sits
  directly on a plain block box, not a specialised-layout element — there is
  no separate "internal grid" underneath any of them for a host's resize to
  miss, so direct styling there carries none of the table's risk.

## Conclusion

Not a systemic pattern — `<table>` was uniquely exposed because it's the only
rendered element with its own native layout algorithm capable of running
independently of its own CSS box. Both occurrences (in-place, `preview`)
shared one root cause, and both are now fixed at the source; no further
instances found to chase.

The broader, genuinely recurring shape across both bugs _is_ worth carrying
forward as a standing check, not a CSS audit: **when a host needs to resize a
surface stylo renders, verify with a real measurement that the override
reaches the actual visible content, not a box one layer removed from it** —
the same discipline `0.15.1` and `0.15.2` each already applied by measuring
in a real Chromium rather than trusting `getBoundingClientRect()` on the
outer element alone.
