# Toolbar — inline marks nest, a wikilink button, table-aware block commands

Three toolbar changes shipped alongside the table work.

## Inline marks were eating each other

`toggleWrap` (bold `**`, italic `*`, strike `~~`, code `` ` ``, inline math
`$`) decides between _wrap_ and _unwrap_ by looking at the characters flanking
the selection. Its "the marks sit just outside" check matched a bare
`sliceDoc(from - m, from) === mark`, so applying **italic** to an already-bold
`**word**` saw a `*` on each side — the inner asterisk of `**` — and _stripped_
it, leaving `*word*`. Bold-then-italic silently deleted the bold. Italic-then-
bold happened to work only because there was no second `*` to satisfy the
`=== "**"` test.

### Fix

`surroundsExactly(before, after, m)` gates both unwrap branches (marks inside
the selection, and marks just outside): a run of the mark character on each side
counts as a strippable instance only when it is long enough — `>= m` for the
two-char marks, and an **odd** length for `*`, since `*x*` and `***x***` carry a
lone italic asterisk but `**x**` does not. So:

- `italic` on `**word**` → `***word***` (nests; run of 2 is even, so wrap)
- `italic` on `***word***` → `**word**` (run of 3 is odd, so strip one)
- `bold` on `***word***` → `*word*` (run of 3 ≥ 2, strip two)
- every mark toggles back off cleanly from any nesting order

## Wikilink button

There was a `link` command for `[text](url)` but nothing for `[[target]]`,
despite wikilinks being a first-class Stylo construct (`onWikiLinkClick`, the
in-place collapse, `remark-wikilink`). Added `wikilink`:

- Registered in `commands.ts` next to `link`, shortcut `Mod-Shift-k`, default
  icon a `[[` double-bracket glyph in `icons.tsx` (matching Wikimedia's
  `Wikilink.svg`), and a slot after `link` in `DEFAULT_TOOLBAR_ITEMS`.
- `toggleWikiLink` / `wikiLinkActive` in `inline.ts` wrap the selection as
  `[[selection]]` (or `[[target]]` when empty) with the target text selected;
  with the caret inside a `[[target|label]]` they unwrap to the display text —
  the label if present, else the target — mirroring how `link` unlinks.
- `wikiLinkAt` scans the caret's line with the shared `WIKILINK_PATTERN` from
  `src/wikilink.ts`, so it never drifts from the render and in-place scanners.

## Context-aware buttons

`ToolbarCommand` gains an optional `disabled?(state)`. A button renders
`disabled` and its shortcut is a no-op (the `keymap.ts` wrapper checks it first)
when the command can't produce valid Markdown at the caret. Four small context
predicates in `commands.ts` drive it: `tableActive` (the `insertTable` line
scan), `inFrontmatter` (`frontmatterRange`), `fencedCodeActive` / `mathBlockActive`
(existing syntax-tree checks), and `inHeading` (an ATX-line regex). `inLiteral`
combines the middle three — contexts where markup is literal or means something
else.

The map, by caret line:

- **table cell** — block commands off (`h1`–`h3`, `quote`, lists, `hr`,
  `frontmatter`, `table`); inline commands stay; `codeBlock` / `mathBlock`
  **degrade** — their `run`/`isActive` call `toggleWrap`/`wrapActive` with
  `` ` `` / `$` when `tableActive`, wrapping the cell selection inline instead of
  fencing.
- **heading line** — `bulletList`, `orderedList`, `task`, `codeBlock`,
  `mathBlock`, `frontmatter`, `table` off. `h1`–`h3` (the toggle), `quote`
  (`> # x` is valid), `hr`, and inline stay.
- **frontmatter block** — everything off except `frontmatter` (so it can toggle
  the block off).
- **fenced code** — everything off except `codeBlock` (the unwrap toggle).
- **`$$` math** — everything off except `mathBlock`.

`link` and `wikilink` count as inline (`[text](url)` / `[[target]]` carry no
`|`, so they are cell-safe) and are only disabled in the literal contexts.

## Verification

`typecheck`, 132 Vitest tests (18 new in `test/toolbar.test.tsx` — bold/italic
nesting in both orders, bold+italic+strike on then off, toggling one mark off
mid-stack, the three wikilink cases, a `disabledAt(doc, pos)` matrix asserting
the exact disabled set for a plain paragraph, a table cell, a heading line, a
frontmatter block, a fenced code block and a `$$` block, `codeBlock`/`mathBlock`
degrading to inline in a cell but still fencing outside, and the `h2` button
toggling its `disabled` attribute as the caret enters and leaves a table row),
`build`, `format:check`. Confirmed in a real Chromium: `Bold` then `Italic`
yields `***word***`, the wikilink button wraps and unwraps, and the disabled set
changes correctly as the caret moves between a paragraph, a heading, a `---`
block, a fence and a `$$` block.
