# Project Genesis — Stylo extracted from Sympose

## Context

Sympose's `ui/` dashboard needs a real Markdown editor for the vault note panel
(`src/components/sympose/markdown-panel.tsx`), which is currently a static mock
with an inert toolbar. A hard requirement is LaTeX math support, since vault
notes carry `$…$` / `$$…$$` expressions.

The editor is not Sympose-specific — the same plain-text Markdown + math surface
is wanted across other projects. Rather than build it inside `ui/`, it is being
started as a standalone, reusable React component library.

## What happened

- Created a new repository, **Stylo**, at `git@github.com:studiodamiro/stylo.git`
  (published to npm as the scoped package `@damiro/stylo` — the unscoped name is
  taken).
- Seeded it from Sympose:
  - Engineering guidelines written for Stylo — kept the
    stack-agnostic execution guidelines (think before coding, simplicity &
    modular cleanliness, surgical changes & verification, the < 200 LOC ceiling),
    dropped the Python-only rules (TTFT SLA, path-traversal, mutexes, persona
    regex), and added a **plain-text-first architecture** section as the project
    north star. Documentation standards (dual Wiki + Journal/ADR system, Obsidian
    YAML frontmatter) carried over with tags renamespaced to `stylo/…`.
- Wrote the initial `README.md`: description, rationale, planned stack table, and
  a `<Stylo value onChange mode onWikiLinkClick />` API sketch.
- Added a Node/Vite `.gitignore`.
- Recorded [ADR-001](./2026-09-01_adr-001-editor-architecture.md): compose from
  primitives (CodeMirror 6 + `remark`/`rehype` + KaTeX), plain text is canonical,
  no WYSIWYG editor framework.
- Wrote `docs/wiki/index.md` and `docs/wiki/architecture/overview.md` (with a
  Mermaid data-flow diagram) and the `docs/PROJECT_JOURNAL.md` ADR index.

## State at end of session

Scaffold only — no build tooling, no `package.json`, no source. `main` tracks
`origin/main`. A follow-up session added
[ADR-002](./2026-09-01_adr-002-editor-ux-and-customization.md) (editor UX,
customization API, design system), which amends ADR-001 to make the `in-place`
live-preview canvas the default view; the "Next" list below reflects that.

## Next

- Scaffold the build: Vite library mode + TypeScript, `package.json` scripts
  (`dev`, `typecheck`, `test`, `build`), a playground entry. Add `LICENSE`,
  `tsconfig.json`, and a bundle-size budget check.
- Stand up the foundation editing surface first — CodeMirror 6 +
  `@codemirror/lang-markdown` bound to a canonical Markdown string — before
  layering the `in-place` view decorations from ADR-002 on top of it.
- Custom `remark` wikilink plugin.
- KaTeX asset delivery: ship `@damiro/stylo/katex.css` as an opt-in re-export of
  `katex/dist/katex.min.css`; keep Stylo's own stylesheet KaTeX-font-free.
  Recorded in [ADR-003](./2026-09-01_adr-003-katex-math-rendering.md), which also
  confirms KaTeX over MathJax for the live-preview loop and flags Temml/MathML as
  a future revisit.
- `split` and `preview` modes; shared scroll for `split`.
