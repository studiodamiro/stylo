# ADR-006 — Interactive rendered-table editing

- **Status:** Accepted — fully implemented 2026-09-02 as `inPlace.table: "cells"`
  (default `"source"`). See the
  [implementation note](./2026-09-02_interactive-table-cells.md); the per-cell
  Markdown reveal is a [follow-up](./2026-09-02_table-cell-reveal.md), the
  toolbar's inline commands
  [format a cell's selection](./2026-09-02_table-cell-inline-commands.md), and
  [structural controls](./2026-09-02_table-structural-controls.md) (add/remove
  column, insert/remove row, column alignment) land as hover affordances on the
  widget.
- **Date:** 2026-09-02
- **Deciders:** damiro, Grace

## Context

Tables render on both surfaces. Authoring them has two tiers:

1. **Aligned-source editing** (shipped 2026-09-02). The caret in a table shows
   the raw pipes, kept in a clean grid live: Tab/Shift-Tab/Enter walk the
   cells, the delimiter and column widths rebuild on every edit. This is
   Obsidian's _Source mode_ table experience. It fits Stylo's architecture with
   a keymap plus a `transactionFilter` — no new concepts.

2. **Interactive rendered editing** (this ADR). The caret in a table keeps the
   rendered `<table>` on screen with its cells editable; typing in a `<td>`
   rewrites the matching slice of the Markdown string; Tab/Enter move between
   cells visually; row/column controls appear on the widget. This is Obsidian's
   _Live Preview_ table experience, and the thing most authors picture when
   they think "table editor".

The read-only `tableField` widget already renders the `<table>` off-caret; the
gap is making that widget stay mounted and become a two-way editing surface
while the caret is in the table.

## Decision

**Build tier 2 as its own post-v1 milestone, not now.** When built, it is a
stateful, bidirectional CodeMirror widget:

- The `TableWidget` stays mounted while the selection is inside the table
  (instead of the current reveal-to-source behaviour, gated by a config flag so
  aligned-source stays available).
- Each `<th>` / `<td>` is `contenteditable` (or hosts a lightweight input). A
  cell edit is translated to a `view.dispatch` transaction that replaces that
  cell's span in the Markdown string; the widget re-derives its DOM from the
  new document, so the string stays canonical.
- Tab / Shift-Tab / Enter move DOM focus between cells; the CodeMirror caret is
  parked and the widget owns interaction while focused.
- Structural controls (add/remove row, add/remove column, set alignment) are
  buttons or handles on the widget, each dispatching a string rewrite —
  reusing `serializeGrid` from `table-grid.ts`.
- Undo, paste, and IME are routed through CodeMirror transactions so history
  and collaboration stay coherent.

The Markdown string remains the single source of truth throughout — this does
**not** introduce a document model, and it does not adopt ProseMirror / Lexical
(ADR-001). It is hand-rolled `contenteditable` coordination, scoped to one
widget.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The table experience most authors expect, with no loss of plain-text
  fidelity — the file still round-trips through Obsidian and GitHub.
- Reuses the shipped grid parse/serialize; the incremental work is the widget's
  focus, selection, and transaction plumbing.

### Costs / considerations

- `contenteditable` coordination is the hardest DOM work in the codebase: cell
  focus vs. CM caret, selection restoration after a re-render, paste
  sanitisation, IME composition, and undo granularity each have a long tail.
- The widget must stay in sync with external `value` changes (a prop update
  while a cell is focused) without stealing or dropping the edit.
- It is a milestone-sized effort; shipping it half-done is worse than the
  aligned-source editor, so it stays fully deferred until it can be done
  properly.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Adopt ProseMirror (or a table-specific rich-text lib) for tables only.**
  Brings the document-model dependency ADR-001 exists to avoid, for one
  construct; the interop and bundle costs are disproportionate.
- **Ship only aligned-source editing and stop there.** It is a real
  improvement and the right _first_ step, but pipe-source editing is not the
  end state a Notion/Obsidian-class editor is judged against.
- **A separate modal "table editor" dialog.** Breaks the in-place, plain-text
  flow and duplicates state; rejected on the same grounds as a WYSIWYG
  document model.
