# In-place canvas — menu groups, selection bar in cells, callouts

Three more items off the ["After in-place" list](./2026-09-01_in-place-canvas.md).
No breaking changes — `contextMenu`'s boolean form and the seven-button bar are
unchanged defaults.

## `contextMenu` groups + `selectionBarItems`

`inPlace.contextMenu` now also takes `{ groups: MenuGroupId[] }` — an ordered
subset of `link` / `format` / `paragraph` / `insert` / `clipboard` — to pick and
reorder the right-click menu's top-level sections. `link` and `format` still
yield to `selectionUI` (listing them is a no-op when the marks live on the bar
or toolbar). The table-cell and fenced-code contexts honour `format` /
`clipboard` from the list; their shape is otherwise fixed.

`inPlace.selectionBarItems` — an ordered subset of the seven inline ids the
floating bar shows. Unknown ids are dropped; an empty result falls back to the
default.

`resolveContextMenu` / `resolveSelectionBarItems` in `config.ts` normalise the
prop shapes; `menuGroupsFacet` / `selectionBarItemsFacet` carry them.
`context-menu-actions.ts` builds the menu by walking the group list (each group
its own separator-delimited block) instead of a fixed sequence.

## Selection bar inside an editable table cell

The bar now follows a text selection inside a `table: "cells"` widget. A cell's
selection is a DOM selection (the widget is atomic, so it never reaches
`state.selection`), so `selection-bar.ts` gained:

- a `selectionchange` document listener (guarded on `activeTableCell`), since no
  `ViewUpdate` fires for a DOM selection;
- a `selectionBox()` that measures the DOM range when the editor selection is
  empty but a cell has one;
- mark buttons that route through `runInlineInCell` (they already did — the
  `BUILTIN_COMMANDS` inline commands try the cell first) and skip `view.focus()`
  so the cell keeps its caret;
- link / wikilink buttons that fall back to the plain toggle in a cell — the
  field editor works on `state.selection`, which is collapsed there.

In a cell the buttons are always enabled (the command `disabled` / `isActive`
predicates read the collapsed `state.selection`, so they are skipped).

## Callouts (`> [!note]`)

A blockquote whose first line is `> [!type]` renders as a tinted box on **both**
the in-place canvas and the preview surface. `src/callout.ts` is the shared
source of truth: the `[!type]` token regexes and a `calloutBucket()` that
collapses the ~25 Obsidian type names to five colour buckets (`note` / `tip` /
`warn` / `danger` / `example`). The raw type rides on a `data-callout` attribute
that a `::before` label reads.

- **In-place** (`nodes.ts`): the `Blockquote` branch swaps `cm-inplace-quote`
  for `cm-inplace-callout cm-inplace-callout-<bucket>`, marks the head line
  `cm-inplace-callout-head`, and hides the `[!type]` token off-caret (atomic,
  adjacent to the already-hidden `>` so they coalesce).
- **Preview** (`remark-callout.ts`): a small remark plugin, alongside
  `remark-wikilink`, that strips the token and sets the class + `data-callout`
  on the `<blockquote>`.
- Each bucket sets `--stylo-callout-accent` from `--stylo-callout-<bucket>`
  (`#3b82f6` / `#22c55e` / `#f59e0b` / `#ef4444` / `#a855f7`), overridable at
  either level.

The `-` / `+` fold marker is parsed and ignored — the box always renders open.

## Files

- `src/callout.ts` — new; shared token regexes + bucket map.
- `src/render/remark-callout.ts` — new; the preview remark plugin.
- `src/inplace/config.ts` — `resolveContextMenu` / `resolveSelectionBarItems`,
  `menuGroupsFacet` / `selectionBarItemsFacet`.
- `src/inplace/context-menu-actions.ts` — `menuRows` walks the group list.
- `src/inplace/selection-bar.ts` — DOM-selection / cell path.
- `src/inplace/nodes.ts` — callout detection in the `Blockquote` branch.
- `src/inplace/theme.ts`, `src/styles/stylo.module.css`, `src/styles/tokens.css`
  — callout styling and tokens.
- `src/types.ts` — `MenuGroupId`, `ContextMenuConfig`, `contextMenu` /
  `selectionBarItems` on `InPlaceConfig`.

## Log

- 2026-09-03 — menu-group / bar-item config, the cell selection-bar path, and
  callouts (both surfaces) landed together; 13 tests added
  (`callout.test.ts`, menu-group + `resolve*` cases, the cell-bar test, the
  in-place + preview callout tests). The callout visuals want a real-Chrome look.
