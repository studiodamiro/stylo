# Customization API — in-place decoration toggles

First slice of the developer customization API from
[ADR-002](./2026-09-01_adr-002-editor-ux-and-customization.md), specified in
[ADR-005](./2026-09-01_adr-005-in-place-decoration-toggles.md): a single `inPlace`
prop whose `decorations` record turns individual in-place decoration types off,
leaving that construct as plain source.

## Context

The [in-place canvas](./2026-09-01_in-place-canvas.md) renders twelve Markdown
constructs. Which ones a host wants depends on the field — a CMS body, a comment
box, and a raw-notes surface each want a different subset. The recurring "can we
turn X off?" question through the canvas build is answered here.

## Scope

- **In:** per-type enable/disable toggles for all twelve constructs, via
  `inPlace={{ decorations: { … } }}`. Default is every key `true` — unchanged
  behaviour.
- **Out (deferred, each its own decision):** `reveal: "line" | "node"`,
  frontmatter display mode, table rendering options, any consumer decorator
  hook or CodeMirror extension pass-through.

## Design

- One grouped `inPlace` object prop, so `reveal` and `frontmatter` groups can
  join `decorations` later without new top-level props.
- A CodeMirror `Facet` (`inPlaceConfigFacet`) carries the resolved toggles;
  each of the four decoration producers (view plugin, `blockMathField`,
  `frontmatterField`, `tableField`) reads it and skips a disabled construct.
- The state fields stay singletons — the facet, not a factory, holds config —
  so the existing suite is untouched.
- Config is read at canvas construction; runtime changes need a remount.

## Log

- 2026-09-01 — increment 1: ADR-005 written; scope fixed to on/off toggles only,
  with reveal mode, frontmatter display mode, table options, and any decorator
  hook explicitly deferred. Shape settled as one `inPlace` object prop;
  mechanism settled as a facet read by all four producers, fields kept as
  singletons. Journal, ADR index, and wiki index synced.
- 2026-09-01 — increment 2: `src/inplace/config.ts` adds `inPlaceConfigFacet`
  and `resolveToggles`, defaulting every key `true`. `inPlaceExtension` seeds
  the facet from the new `inPlace` option; the view plugin's `decorate.ts`,
  `nodes.ts`'s per-branch checks, and the `math` / `frontmatter` / `tables`
  state fields all read it and skip their construct when its key is `false`.
  `InPlaceDecorationToggles` and `InPlaceConfig` are new public types in
  `src/types.ts`, exported from the barrel; `Stylo` threads `inPlace` through
  to `InPlaceView`, which bakes it into the extension array built once at
  mount. Five new tests cover a representative toggle per producer plus the
  `tasks`/`lists` interaction (`tasks: false` leaves `- [ ]` fully as source).
  The playground gained a "Customize in-place decorations" panel with all
  twelve checkboxes, remounting the canvas via a config-derived `key` — a live
  demo of the construction-time rule. New wiki page
  [in-place-config.md](../../wiki/reference/in-place-config.md); `props.md`
  gained the `inPlace` row.
- 2026-09-02 — playground verification turned up four real issues, fixed in
  the same slice:
  - **Frontmatter re-check did nothing.** A fresh `EditorState`'s default caret
    sits at position 0 — inside the frontmatter block — so `frontmatterField`
    always started "revealed" (no chip) on any mount, a pre-existing bug the
    toggle's remount made visible every time. Fixed: the field now starts
    folded unconditionally and only reveals on a real selection change.
  - **`code` toggle didn't affect inline code.** Inline `` `code` `` had been
    grouped under `emphasis` in `nodes.ts`'s shared inline-rule table. Split:
    the table now carries a `toggle` per entry, so `code` covers inline code
    and fenced/indented blocks, `emphasis` covers bold/italic/strike only.
  - **Blockquote `>` never hid.** ADR-004 originally kept blockquote markers
    always visible. Changed (amending ADR-004) so `>` hides off-caret and
    reveals on-caret like every other marker, via a new `QuoteMark` case;
    `blockquote: false` now also stops the hiding, not just the framing.
  - **Clicking a rendered widget was hit-or-miss.** A click on KaTeX internals
    or the empty parts of an `<hr>` / the chip could leave the caret unplaced,
    so nothing revealed. Added a narrow `mousedown` handler in
    `inPlaceExtension` that, for a click inside a rendered widget
    (`.cm-inplace-math`, `-hr`, `-frontmatter`, `-table`), drops the caret at
    the widget's document position (amending ADR-004's "click a widget → caret
    at its edge" claim); `HrWidget` and `FrontmatterWidget` also needed
    `ignoreEvent` flipped to `false` for the handler to see their events. Text
    and line padding stay with CodeMirror; an earlier version that also
    intercepted decorated-line padding was reverted — it forced the caret to a
    line edge and broke precise clicking in revealed source.

## Known issue — immediate follow-up

Decorations that **collapse line height** desync CodeMirror's click → document
position mapping: a click lands on the line above or below the target. Confirmed
in the playground by toggling constructs off one at a time.

- **Frontmatter chip** — the main offender. A `block: true` widget replaces the
  four-line YAML block with a one-line chip; every click below it drifts.
  Turning `frontmatter` off restores accurate clicking.
- **Fenced code** — the `cm-inplace-code-pad` rows render at `height: 0`; milder
  drift around and below a code block.

Pre-existing (both predate this slice); the "chip shows on mount" fix just made
the frontmatter case visible on every load. The fix is to stop collapsing line
height — keep the YAML rows full-height but dimmed with a label, and give code
fences real row height — tracked as the next task, not folded in here so the
toggle slice can land verified.

## After this slice

- `inPlace.reveal` — `"line" | "node"` cursor-reveal granularity.
- `inPlace.frontmatter` — `source` / `chip` / `properties` display mode; the
  `properties` panel waits on the deferred YAML exposure work (its own ADR).
- Table rendering options — inline cell formatting, style hooks.
- Consumer decorator hook — its own ADR once concrete use cases exist.
