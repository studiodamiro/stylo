# In-place canvas — build tracker

Living checklist for the `in-place` view mode: Obsidian-style live preview where
the raw Markdown stays in the document and CodeMirror **view decorations** render
it in place, stepping back to source when the cursor enters a node. Update the
increment table and the log as each piece lands.

The architecture and the scope below are formalised in **ADR-004** — write that
first (increment 0).

## v1 scope

### Decorated in v1

- Headings — display size, `#` markers hidden off the cursor line
- Emphasis — bold / italic / strikethrough / inline code; markers hidden
  off-cursor
- Links + wikilinks — collapse `[text](url)` and `[[target|label]]` to the
  label; activating a wikilink fires `onWikiLinkClick`
- Block math `$$…$$` — replaced with a rendered KaTeX widget; arrow or click to
  edit
- Inline math `$…$` — inline KaTeX widget
- Horizontal rule — rendered line
- Blockquote — left border and muted colour; markers kept
- List markers — bullet glyph styling
- Task checkboxes — interactive `<input>` toggling `[ ]` ⇄ `[x]` in the source
  _(pulled in from the deferred list before the default flip — a raw `- [ ]`
  under the default mode reads as unfinished; ADR-004 scope amendment)_
- Rendered tables — GFM pipe tables become a `<table>` widget with per-column
  alignment; the caret entering a table line reveals the source. Cell text is
  verbatim _(increment 8, just after the default flip; ADR-004 scope amendment)_

### Explicitly out of v1 (stay source-styled)

- Image inline previews
- Embeds / transclusions

_Highlighted code fences were listed here until 2026-09-02: the `codeLanguages`
prop ([note](./2026-09-02_code-languages-prop.md)) feeds the in-place canvas too,
so a fenced block is grammar-highlighted when the consumer opts in._

## Standing decisions

- **Default `mode` stayed `source`** until in-place was proven; increment 7
  flipped it to `in-place` (ADR-002 §1). `mode="source"` stays the plain
  surface that loads no render chunk.
- **The in-place plugin is lazy-loaded** (like `Preview`), so it carries `katex`
  into its own chunk and `mode="source"` consumers never fetch it.
- Decorations are built over the **visible viewport only**, rebuilt on
  `docChanged`, viewport change, and `selectionSet` (for cursor reveal).
- Replaced block widgets are marked `atomic` so the caret steps over them
  instead of into hidden text.
- Each increment is its own commit, verifiable in the playground.

## Log

- 2026-09-01 — tracker created; v1 scope and standing decisions agreed.
- 2026-09-01 — increment 0: ADR-004 written; ADR-002 §1 given a rollout pointer;
  index and wiki tables synced.
- 2026-09-01 — increment 1: `src/inplace/` decoration plugin (viewport-scoped
  builder, `revealedLines` cursor-reveal, base theme); lazy `InPlaceView` wired
  into `Stylo`; `useCodeMirror` gained an `extensions` option. ATX headings
  render at display size with `#` markers hidden off the caret line. The
  "unimplemented mode" warning is gone now that every `mode` is handled.
- 2026-09-01 — increment 2: `decorate.ts` rebuilt around an unordered range list
  sorted by `Decoration.set` (so nested and overlapping spans are legal); a
  shared inline rule table covers strong / emphasis / strikethrough / inline
  code, hiding each marker off the caret line. The canvas now renders in a
  proportional font (`inPlaceTheme` raised with `Prec.high` to beat the base
  monospace theme); inline code and fenced/indented code keep a monospace class.
- 2026-09-01 — increment 3: the `[[…]]` pattern moved to `src/wikilink.ts` and is
  now shared with `remark-wikilink`. `decorate.ts` styles standard `[text](url)`
  links (hiding `[` and the `](url)` tail) and runs a regex pass for wikilinks,
  collapsing them to the label and skipping matches inside code spans/blocks.
  A collapsed wikilink carries `data-stylo-wikilink`; a delegated `click`
  handler in `inPlaceExtension` calls `onWikiLinkClick`, threaded from `Stylo`
  through `InPlaceView` via a ref. Also fixed: the heading branch no longer
  stops the tree walk, so emphasis and links inside a heading are decorated.
- 2026-09-01 — increment 4: the in-place module was split for the 200-line
  ceiling — `scan.ts` (shared `inCodeContext` / `rangeRevealed`), `wikilinks.ts`,
  `math.ts`. `math.ts` renders `$…$` and single-line `$$…$$` from the viewport
  plugin and multi-line `$$…$$` blocks from a `StateField` (a `ViewPlugin` may
  not emit a replacement that spans line breaks); the field scans the whole
  document, acceptable because `$$` blocks are few. Widgets call
  `katex.render` directly. `atomicRanges` are provided from both the plugin and
  the field so the caret steps over rendered math. `katex` is now shared
  (deduplicated) between the preview and in-place chunks.
- 2026-09-01 — increment 5: the tree-node handling moved from `decorate.ts` into
  `nodes.ts`, leaving `decorate.ts` a thin orchestrator. Added horizontal rules
  (an `<hr>` widget, atomic), blockquote line framing (border + muted colour,
  `>` kept), and `-` / `*` / `+` list markers swapped for a `•` glyph — task
  items (`- [ ]`, which the grammar wraps in a `Task` node) are left as source
  since checkboxes are deferred. `frontmatter.ts` finds the leading `---` … `---`
  block by hand (no grammar node) and a state field hides it behind a
  "Properties" chip, revealed when the caret enters it; `decorate.ts` skips
  every node inside that range. Chip-vs-rendered-properties is recorded as a v1
  API-pass decision.
- 2026-09-01 — fenced code fix: fenced / indented code blocks render inside a
  monospace, tinted, rounded container. Off-caret, a fenced block's ` ``` `
  lines have their text replaced and the rows collapse to zero height, acting as
  the container's padding; the caret entering the block restores the fences
  (dimmed).
- 2026-09-01 — increment 6: the atomic-range set is now derived by filtering
  every replacing decoration out of the built set — marker-hiding replaces
  included, not just widgets — so the caret jumps hidden `#`, `**`, `[[`, `](…)`
  in one keypress. The separate `atomic` array threaded through `nodes.ts` and
  `math.ts` is gone. The line-span reveal model is kept as ADR-004 chose it;
  per-node reveal is left to the customization API as a `reveal` option.
- 2026-09-01 — increment 7: `Stylo`'s default `mode` is now `in-place` (ADR-002
  §1). `types.ts` and the playground updated; ADR-002 §1 and ADR-004's staging
  section marked complete; `props.md` and `overview.md` describe the full node
  set and note `mode="source"` as the no-render-chunk path. `<Stylo value
onChange />` with no `mode` now lazy-loads the in-place chunk (and the shared
  ~85 kB gzip KaTeX chunk) on mount — the intended tradeoff for the default
  experience; `mode="source"` stays the zero-dependency surface.
- 2026-09-01 — increment 6b: task checkboxes, pulled in from the deferred list
  ahead of the default flip. A `TaskMarker` node becomes a `CheckboxWidget`
  (`<input type="checkbox">`); toggling dispatches a one-character change,
  `" "` ⇄ `"x"`, at the position resolved from the widget DOM. The `- ` list
  marker is hidden on task rows so the line reads as just the checkbox and its
  text. The caret entering the line restores the `- [ ]` source. Recorded as an
  ADR-004 scope amendment.
- 2026-09-01 — increment 8: rendered GFM tables. `src/inplace/tables.ts` adds a
  `tableField` state field (not the view plugin — the replacement spans line
  breaks) that walks the tree for `Table` nodes and replaces each with a
  `block: true` `<table class="cm-inplace-table">` widget. Header cells, body
  rows, and per-column alignment are read straight from the Lezer `TableCell`
  and `TableDelimiter` children; the widget's `eq()` compares the parsed shape
  so it is reused across unrelated edits. The caret on any table line reveals
  the source, and the field is atomic so arrows step over the block. Cell text
  is rendered verbatim — no inline formatting inside cells yet. Theme rules
  mirror the preview's table CSS; the playground demo table gained a
  right-aligned column.
- 2026-09-02 — click-to-position accuracy. The frontmatter "Properties" chip
  (a `block: true` widget folding the YAML to one line) is replaced with line
  decorations that recess the block in place at full height — muted, monospace,
  a CSS "Properties" label, `---` fences hidden off-caret. Then every vertical
  `margin` in `theme.ts` (math block, `<hr>`, table, fenced-code container) was
  converted to `padding`: CodeMirror's height map measures border boxes, so a
  `margin` — or a folded block widget — is vertical space it cannot see, and the
  caret drifted further off the further down the document a click landed. The
  `<hr>` rule is now a centred background hairline. With the drift gone the
  fenced-code fence rows collapse to zero height again off-caret, giving a
  compact `preview`-sized container. Full write-up:
  [click-to-position accuracy](./2026-09-02_in-place-click-mapping.md).
- 2026-09-02 — `codeLanguages` prop. Forwarded to `markdown()` through the shared
  `useCodeMirror` / `baseExtensions` path, so the in-place canvas gets
  grammar-highlighted fenced code when a consumer opts in — no in-place-specific
  code. Container styling unchanged. Full write-up:
  [`codeLanguages` prop](./2026-09-02_code-languages-prop.md).
- 2026-09-02 — the recessed YAML block's `::before` label changed from
  `"Properties"` to `"Frontmatter"`, matching the new `preview` `frontmatter`
  prop and keeping the raw block clearly distinct from a parsed-properties view.
  See the [preview-frontmatter note](./2026-09-02_preview-frontmatter.md).
- 2026-09-02 — links restyled to colour, not underline. `.cm-inplace-link` and
  `.cm-inplace-wikilink` now take a standard link blue from the new
  `--stylo-link` token (default `#2563eb`); the underline is gone. `preview`'s
  `<a>` follows the same token, also without an underline, so both surfaces
  match. `--stylo-accent` is left for active / pressed states. Recorded as the
  ADR-002 §3 amendment (the token set is now eight).

## After in-place

- **In-place customization API** — per-type on/off toggles landed as
  [ADR-005](./2026-09-01_adr-005-in-place-decoration-toggles.md) (the `inPlace`
  prop). Still open: cursor-reveal granularity, a frontmatter display mode,
  image previews, and any hook for consumer-supplied decorators — each its own
  future decision. _Nested-list indent guides landed 2026-09-03_
  ([note](./2026-09-03_table-menu-shell-and-list-guides.md)); _callout
  blockquotes (`> [!note]`) landed 2026-09-03_
  ([note](./2026-09-03_menu-groups-cell-bar-callouts.md)).
- **Table rendering options** — v1 renders one fixed table style and shows cell
  text verbatim. _Table **editing** landed 2026-09-02_ — a `table` toolbar
  command, Tab/Shift-Tab/Enter cell navigation, and live pipe alignment on the
  raw source ([note](./2026-09-02_table-editing.md)); the interactive
  rendered-table editor is [ADR-006](./2026-09-02_adr-006-interactive-table-editing.md).
  Still open for the customization pass: inline formatting inside rendered cells
  (`**bold**`, `` `code` ``, links, math). _Consumer-facing table style hooks
  landed 2026-09-03_ — `--stylo-table-border` / `--stylo-table-header-bg` /
  `--stylo-table-stripe-bg` on both the in-place and preview surfaces
  ([note](./2026-09-03_table-menu-shell-and-list-guides.md)).
- **Frontmatter display mode** — the canvas recesses the YAML block in place
  (muted monospace, a "Properties" label, `---` fences hidden off-caret). Make
  this configurable: at least `source` (leave it raw), `inline` (current default
  — the recessed style), and `properties` (a rendered key/value panel). The
  `properties` mode depends on the deferred frontmatter _exposure_ work from
  ADR-001 (parsing the YAML — `gray-matter` / a YAML dependency and its own ADR,
  plus the `onFrontmatter` prop), so it lands with that, not before.
- The rest of the post-foundation work is unchanged and tracked in the
  [foundation milestone](./2026-09-01_foundation-milestone.md) "Next" list:
  declarative toolbar, `codeLanguages` prop, v1 public-API pass, publish
  automation.
