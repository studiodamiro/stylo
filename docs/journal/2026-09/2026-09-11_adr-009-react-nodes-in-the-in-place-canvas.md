# ADR-009 — Rendering host React nodes in the in-place canvas

- **Status:** Accepted — implemented in 0.9.0. Motivated by extending
  `![[embed]]` (0.8.0, preview / split) to the in-place canvas.
- **Date:** 2026-09-11
- **Deciders:** damiro, Grace

## Context

`![[ref]]` transclusion shipped in 0.8.0 for the `preview` and `split` surfaces.
The contract is [`EmbedSource`](../../../src/types.ts):

```ts
type EmbedSource = (ref: string) => ReactNode | Promise<ReactNode>
```

Stylo has no vault, so it detects the `![[…]]` and the host returns a React node
to render in its place. `preview` is a `react-markdown` pipeline, so dropping a
host node in is trivial — [`src/render/Embed.tsx`](../../../src/render/Embed.tsx)
awaits the promise and renders the result, with the literal `![[ref]]` text as
the pending / rejected / `null` fallback.

The **in-place canvas** is the remaining surface. There, `![[ref]]` currently
renders as a bare `!` followed by a collapsed `[[ref]]` wikilink chip — the
embed syntax is not recognised, only its inner `[[…]]`.

The obstacle is architectural, not incidental:

- Every construct the canvas renders is built with **imperative DOM**.
  `MathWidget` calls `katex.render`; `EditableTableWidget` hand-assembles a
  `<table>` and owns it. There is **no React inside a CodeMirror `WidgetType`
  anywhere in the codebase**, by design — ADR-001 and ADR-004 put CodeMirror at
  the surface and compose the rest from primitives.
- But `EmbedSource` returns **host React** — an arbitrary `ReactNode`, possibly
  with its own state, effects, context, and Suspense. Rendering an embed in the
  canvas means mounting host React inside a CodeMirror widget. Nothing else does
  this, so the decision earns an ADR rather than a journal entry.
- CodeMirror **recreates widgets aggressively** as the viewport scrolls. A
  widget's `toDOM` runs often and its `eq()` must be cheap; anything expensive or
  stateful built in `toDOM` is rebuilt on every scroll pass that crosses it.

## Decision

Render host React into canvas embeds through a **portal registry**: the widget
contributes an inert slot element, and a single React subtree owned by
`InPlaceView` portals the embed content into every live slot.

### Accepted for the first release

- **The widget is inert DOM.** `EmbedWidget.toDOM()` returns an empty
  `<div class="cm-inplace-embed" data-stylo-embed-slot="<id>">` — no React, no
  resolution, cheap to build. `eq()` compares `ref` (and the monotonic slot
  `id`), so CodeMirror reuses the slot across scrolls and rebuilds it only when
  the reference changes.
- **A `StateField` is the registry.** `embedSlotsField` holds
  `{ id, ref, dom }` for every off-caret `![[ref]]` block the decoration pass
  currently renders. It updates as decorations are recomputed.
- **`InPlaceView` renders the bridge.** It subscribes to `embedSlotsField`
  (through `useSyncExternalStore` over a tiny view-plugin-backed store) and, for
  each slot, portals an `<Embed>` into `slot.dom` with `createPortal`. One React
  tree: [`Embed.tsx`](../../../src/render/Embed.tsx) is reused verbatim, so the
  async path and the `![[ref]]` fallbacks carry over unchanged, and Suspense /
  error boundaries / context all work.
- **`embedSource` is mount-time canvas config.** Threaded
  `Stylo → LazyInPlaceView → InPlaceView` and into the extension as a facet,
  read once when the canvas is constructed — the same lifecycle as
  `wikiLinkSource` and `codeLanguages` (see the ADR-005 config-lifecycle
  amendment).
- **Reveal-on-caret, reusing the existing machinery.** An off-caret lone-line
  `![[ref]]` gets `Decoration.replace({ widget, block: true })`; when the caret
  is on the line the decoration is withheld and the raw source shows. This is
  exactly the block-math path (`revealedLines` / `rangeRevealed`).
- **`scanWikilinks` yields to `!` when embeds are active.** A one-character
  lookbehind: skip a `[[ref]]` immediately preceded by `!` — but only when
  `embedSource` is set (the pass reads `embedRegistryFacet != null`), so the
  embed pass and the wikilink pass never both decorate the same span. A consumer
  not using the feature sees no change: `![[ref]]` still renders as a literal `!`
  plus a collapsed `[[ref]]` chip, consistent with the opt-in discipline the
  0.8.0 work set for `preview`.
- **Gated by `inPlace.decorations.embeds`** (new toggle, default `true`),
  consistent with ADR-005.

### Deferred (post-v1, additive)

- ~~**Inline `![[…]]`** mid-paragraph~~ Landed after 0.9.0: `remark-embed`
  splits text nodes into a `<span data-stylo-embed-inline>` for `preview` /
  `split`; `embedField` emits a non-`block` `EmbedWidget` (a `<span>` slot) for a
  non-lone `![[ref]]` on the canvas. `Embed` gains an `inline` prop. The host
  should return phrasing content for these.
- **`![[…]]` inside editable table cells.**
- **The unconditional `scanWikilinks` lookbehind** — skipping `![[ref]]` even
  when `embedSource` is unset, so a bare `![[ref]]` never renders as a link chip
  anywhere. A small cleanup, but it is a visible change for consumers not using
  embeds, so it waits for a deliberate minor-version note rather than riding in
  on this feature.
- ~~**Memoising resolved nodes across scroll.**~~ Landed after 0.9.0:
  `src/render/embed-cache.ts`, a `WeakMap<EmbedSource, Map<ref, entry>>` shared by
  `preview` and the canvas, in-flight promises deduped, rejections not cached,
  capped at 64 refs per resolver. An embed re-scrolled into view is served from
  cache with no re-`embedSource` call and no loading flash.
- **A recursion guard** for `embedSource` returning a nested
  `<Stylo mode="in-place">`. The host's responsibility for now, documented.

### Revisit trigger

Re-evaluate if React ships a first-class "render into detached DOM" primitive
that removes the registry plumbing, or if scroll-churn profiling on a large
document shows the portal bridge is a bottleneck.

## Consequences

### Positive

- In-place `![[ref]]` becomes first-class, matching `preview` — closing the last
  surface gap for the feature and not re-opening the "why doesn't in-place match
  the render?" question ADR-007 is working to close.
- **One React tree.** No per-widget React root lifecycle, no `flushSync`, no
  island contexts. Error boundaries and Suspense apply to every embed at once.
- `Embed.tsx` stays the single implementation for both pipelines; its fallbacks
  are tested once.
- The `scanWikilinks` lookbehind fixes a pre-existing rendering glitch as a side
  effect.

### Costs / considerations

- **First standing React ↔ CodeMirror coupling.** The registry is a permanent
  bridge between the extension's `StateField` and the React tree; until now the
  canvas was self-contained DOM. New failure mode: a slot `<div>` recycled by
  CodeMirror while a portal still targets it. Mitigations: portals keyed by a
  monotonic slot `id`; drop any portal whose `dom` has detached from the
  document; `eq()` returns `false` on a `ref` change so CodeMirror rebuilds the
  slot rather than mutating it under React.
- **Scroll churn.** Each scroll that reveals an embed mounts a portal and — until
  the deferred cache — re-invokes `embedSource`. Cheap for a synchronous source;
  a network-backed source should debounce or cache host-side, the same advice
  `wikiLinkSource` already carries.
- **No new dependency.** `createPortal` comes from `react-dom`, already a peer
  dependency. The in-place chunk grows by the registry (~1–2 kB), within the
  `check:size` budget headroom.
- **No new SSR constraint.** The canvas is already client-only (lazy chunk);
  portals add nothing.
- **Testing.** jsdom can drive the registry (a portal into a detached node
  works), so the resolution and fallback logic stays in Vitest. The visual and
  scroll-lifecycle behaviour goes in `test/browser/embed.spec.ts` — the first
  browser spec for embeds, justified here because it is layout plus widget
  lifecycle, exactly what the harness exists for.

## Alternatives rejected

- **`createRoot()` per `EmbedWidget`.** `toDOM` creates a React root, `destroy`
  unmounts it. Simplest to write. Rejected: CodeMirror recreates widgets on every
  viewport change, so this churns React roots on scroll; each root is an island
  with no shared context or error boundary; and `createRoot` driven from `toDOM`
  fights React 18's concurrent scheduler — you either `flushSync` on mount or
  accept a paint flash. The registry pays one coordination cost instead of a
  per-widget one.
- **A DOM-only sibling contract for the canvas** — let `embedSource` also return
  an `HTMLElement` and have the canvas take that path. Rejected: two contracts
  for one feature, and it degrades the common case (a host returning JSX) on the
  surface where a rendered view matters most.
- **A placeholder chip only** (`📄 ref`), never the content, click to open it in
  `preview`. Much less work, no React in the canvas. Rejected: the canvas exists
  to edit against a rendered view (ADR-004, ADR-007). A chip is a second-class
  embed and widens the exact gap the seamless-in-place work is narrowing.
- **Serialise the host node to an HTML string and `innerHTML` it.** Rejected: a
  `ReactNode` is not serialisable without `renderToStaticMarkup`, which pulls
  `react-dom/server` into the client bundle, strips interactivity and effects,
  and cannot represent a stateful host component. A non-starter for "return
  whatever React you want."
- **Defer in-place embeds indefinitely** — leave `![[ref]]` as raw source in the
  canvas. Rejected as the end state: it is the gap being closed. But noted as the
  documented fallback — if the portal registry proves too costly in practice,
  raw-source-in-canvas is the honest degradation, not a broken half-render.

## Rollout log

**0.9.0 — implemented as specified**, with these settlements made during the build:

- **The registry is a small class, not a `StateField`.** `EmbedRegistry`
  ([`src/inplace/embed-registry.ts`](../../../src/inplace/embed-registry.ts))
  holds `{ id, ref, el }` per slot with `subscribe` / `getSnapshot` for
  `useSyncExternalStore`; `EmbedWidget.toDOM` / `destroy` write to it. The
  decoration set stays a field (`embedField`) beside `blockMathField`, but the
  slot⇒DOM mapping lives in the class — a `StateField` value cannot hold a DOM
  node that only exists once the widget mounts. Registry notifications are
  coalesced through one `queueMicrotask`, so a CodeMirror update that touches
  several slots is one React render.
- **`embedSource` presence is the gate.** `InPlaceView` passes the registry into
  the extension only when `embedSource` is set; `embedField` and the
  `scanWikilinks` `!`-yield both read `embedRegistryFacet != null`. A consumer
  without the prop sees no change.
- **Interactive host content wins over reveal-on-click.** A click inside a
  resolved `.stylo-embed-content` is left to the host node. Revealing the raw
  `![[ref]]` is by caret-on-line, or by clicking the slot's own box / a pending
  or failed embed's literal text. `.cm-inplace-embed` is in `REVEAL_WIDGET` for
  that second path.
- **Scroll memoisation** was deferred at 0.9.0 and landed just after — see the
  struck-through entry under _Deferred_ above (`src/render/embed-cache.ts`).
- Coverage: `test/embed-registry.test.ts` (the class),
  `test/inplace-embed.test.tsx` (the field — widget off-caret, withheld
  on-caret, gated by the prop, `!`-yield), `test/browser/embed.spec.ts` (the
  portal into the slot, caret reveal, interactive content, the no-prop
  fallback).
