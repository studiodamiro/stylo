# `![[embed]]` transclusion

## Context

`![[ref]]` was the last item on the Sympose integration audit's Stylo-side list.
It is Obsidian's transclusion syntax: pull another note, a heading, a block, or
an image in where the `![[…]]` sits. Everything else in the audit was closed by
the `[[wikilink]]` autocomplete work; this finishes the set.

The wall is the same one `[[wikilinks]]` hit. Stylo's canonical model is a
Markdown string and it has **no vault** — no notion of what other notes exist or
what they contain. So it cannot resolve `ref` itself, exactly as it cannot
navigate a `[[wikilink]]` (`onWikiLinkClick`) or rank completions
(`wikiLinkSource`). Detection is Stylo's; resolution is the host's.

## Decision

A new prop, **`embedSource`**:

```ts
type EmbedSource = (ref: string) => ReactNode | Promise<ReactNode>
```

`ref` is the raw string between `![[` and `]]`, trimmed — any `#heading`,
`#^blockid`, or `|size` suffix left intact. The host returns a React node; Stylo
drops it where the `![[…]]` was. `null` (or a rejection, or the pending state)
leaves the literal `![[ref]]` text in place, so a reference is never silently
lost.

Implemented as:

- [`src/embed.ts`](../../../src/embed.ts) — `EMBED_PATTERN` and an `isLoneEmbed`
  guard.
- [`src/render/remark-embed.ts`](../../../src/render/remark-embed.ts) — a remark
  plugin that retypes a lone-`![[ref]]` paragraph to an empty
  `<div class="stylo-embed" data-stylo-embed="ref">`.
- [`src/render/Embed.tsx`](../../../src/render/Embed.tsx) — the component that
  calls `embedSource`, awaits a promise, and renders the result inside
  `<div class="stylo-embed-content">`.
- [`src/render/Preview.tsx`](../../../src/render/Preview.tsx) — adds `remarkEmbed`
  to the pipeline (only when `embedSource` is set) and routes `data-stylo-embed`
  to `<Embed>`. Threaded through `Stylo` and `SplitView` to the `preview` and
  `split` surfaces.

### Choices

- **Host returns a React node, not a Markdown string or a tagged descriptor.**
  It matches how the rest of Stylo delegates — navigation, the wikilink index —
  and it is the smallest honest API: Stylo owns the detection and the slot, the
  host owns what goes in it. A host that wants recursive Markdown renders
  `<Stylo mode="preview">` (or its own renderer) into the node. No recursion or
  cycle guard in Stylo, no format negotiation, no new dependency. A Markdown
  string would have forced a depth/cycle limiter and still not covered images or
  PDFs; a `{ kind }` descriptor is a wider surface to keep stable for no gain
  over "return whatever you want".
- **Raw reference, passed verbatim.** `WIKILINK_PATTERN` is deliberately not
  reused — in `![[image.png|300]]` the `|` is a size hint, not a display label,
  so splitting on it would be wrong. `EMBED_PATTERN` is its own regex and the
  whole reference goes to the host to parse.
- **Preview and split only.** The in-place canvas needs an async React widget
  inside the CodeMirror surface with reveal-on-caret behaviour and cursor
  navigation past it — a separate increment. Staging it this way keeps each
  change reviewable, as with the toolbar customizer and wikilink autocomplete.
- **Lone-embed paragraphs only.** An `![[ref]]` is treated as an embed only when
  it is the entire paragraph (trimmed). An `![[ref]]` inside a sentence stays
  literal — rendering it as a block would nest a host-supplied `<div>` inside a
  `<p>`, which React rejects. Inline embeds are a fast-follow item alongside the
  in-place canvas.
- **Opt-in, no behaviour change without the prop.** `Preview` only adds
  `remarkEmbed` to the pipeline when `embedSource` is present, so a document with
  `![[x]]` renders exactly as before (a `!` then a `[[x]]` wikilink) for every
  consumer not using the feature.
- **`embedSource` is reactive, not read-once.** Unlike `wikiLinkSource` and the
  other CodeMirror-surface config, the preview is a pure function of its props —
  a changed `embedSource` just re-renders. The doc note asks for a stable
  reference so the memoised plugin list is not rebuilt each frame.

### Dependency

None. `embedSource` is a function prop; `remark-embed` uses `unist-util-visit`,
already a dependency. No ADR-gated addition.

## Consequences

- One more prop on `StyloProps` (`embedSource`) and one more exported type
  (`EmbedSource`). The props reference gains an "Embeds" section.
- New stable style hooks: `.stylo-embed`, `.stylo-embed-content`, and the
  `--stylo-embed-accent` variable.
- `test/embed.test.ts` covers the pattern and the plugin;
  `test/preview.test.tsx` covers the resolved node, the async path, the literal
  fallbacks, and the inline-`![[…]]` boundary. No browser spec — there is no
  floating UI this time.
- The Sympose audit's Stylo-side list is now empty.

### Follow-ups

- The in-place canvas: a reveal-on-caret block widget, same pattern as `math.ts`
  and the table widgets.
- Inline `![[…]]` (mid-paragraph), once it can render without the `<div>`-in-`<p>`
  nesting problem — likely an inline wrapper element.
