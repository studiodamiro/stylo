# ADR-003 — Math rendering engine and KaTeX asset delivery

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-01
- **Deciders:** damiro

## Context

[ADR-001](./2026-09-01_adr-001-editor-architecture.md) chose `remark-math` +
`rehype-katex` + `katex` for the render pipeline but left one item explicitly
open: KaTeX ships its own webfonts and stylesheet, and how those reach the
consumer was "documented as a peer/setup step" without a concrete decision.

[ADR-002](./2026-09-01_adr-002-editor-ux-and-customization.md) then made the
`in-place` live-preview canvas the default view. That raises the stakes on the
engine choice: math inside the canvas re-typesets as the author types, so the
engine must be **synchronous** and must not shift surrounding layout on each
keystroke.

Two questions therefore need settling:

1. Is KaTeX still the right engine given the live-preview loop, or is there a
   better fit?
2. How are the KaTeX stylesheet and fonts delivered to consumers of a library
   that is itself meant to stay zero-bloat?

### Engine options considered

| Option                        | What it is                                                                                   | Assessment                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **KaTeX**                     | Synchronous LaTeX → HTML + CSS, self-contained webfonts, supports a subset of LaTeX          | Fast, no layout jitter, proven in the same class of tool (Obsidian, Khan Academy, GitHub). The LaTeX subset is sufficient for note-grade math.                                              |
| **MathJax v3**                | Much fuller LaTeX (AMS packages, custom macros, mhchem), SVG or HTML output                  | Async typesetting causes layout shift on every keystroke in the in-place canvas; ~1 MB+; heavier to drive from CodeMirror. The extra LaTeX coverage is not needed for notes.                |
| **Temml → native MathML**     | LaTeX → MathML converter (KaTeX family); the browser renders it with no runtime fonts or CSS | Would remove the asset-delivery problem entirely. But MathML rendering fidelity still varies by browser and installed math fonts in 2026 — too risky to stake "first-class LaTeX" on today. |
| **Build / server pre-render** | Run a typesetter ahead of time, ship HTML                                                    | Inapplicable — the author is typing math live.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Hand-rolled typesetter**    | Implement the box-and-glue model and font metrics                                            | Multi-year effort; same reasoning as ADR-001's rejection of a from-scratch parser.                                                                                                          |

The realistic contest is KaTeX vs. MathJax, and MathJax loses on bundle size and
async reflow for this workload.

## Decision

1. **Engine: KaTeX**, via `rehype-katex`. Synchronous, layout-stable, smallest
   footprint. Its LaTeX subset is accepted as sufficient for the target use case
   (note-taking math), not full document typesetting.

2. **`katex` is a regular `dependency` of Stylo**, with its version range locked
   to what the pinned `rehype-katex` expects. It is **not** a `peerDependency`:
   the JS is tightly coupled to `rehype-katex`, and consumers should not have to
   know KaTeX exists at the JS level or pin a compatible version themselves.

3. **Stylo's shipped `dist/styles.css` contains editor chrome only.** It never
   references KaTeX fonts or bundles KaTeX CSS.

4. **KaTeX styling is a documented one-line setup step for the consumer**, who
   picks one of:
   - `import "@damiro/stylo/katex.css"` — a file Stylo ships that re-exports
     `katex/dist/katex.min.css`. Because `katex` is Stylo's dependency it is
     always resolvable, and this guarantees the CSS version matches the engine
     Stylo runs. **Recommended default.**
   - `import "katex/dist/katex.min.css"` — for consumers who manage `katex`
     directly and want dedupe control.
   - A CDN `<link>` — for no-bundler contexts (plain HTML, Astro islands).

5. **Fonts load on demand.** The browser fetches only the woff2 glyph families a
   document actually uses, from KaTeX's own `fonts/` directory next to its CSS.
   Stylo does not copy, path-rewrite, or inline the font files.

6. **Temml + native MathML is a recorded future revisit**, targeted at the point
   where MathML Core rendering is uniform across evergreen browsers. Switching to
   it would not change the shape of decisions 2–5, and would additionally delete
   the asset-delivery question. Until then, KaTeX stands.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- No layout jitter as math re-typesets in the `in-place` canvas.
- Smallest math footprint of the viable engines; every piece stays modular and
  MIT.
- One documented setup line for consumers; the recommended path guarantees
  engine/CSS version alignment.
- SSR-safe — the stylesheet is static, no client-only typesetting step.
- Stylo's own stylesheet stays small and KaTeX-font-free, preserving the
  "structural CSS only" boundary from the architecture overview.

**Negative / costs**

- Consumers must perform one CSS import. This is documented, not hidden — it
  executes the open item from ADR-001 rather than papering over it.
- KaTeX supports only a subset of LaTeX (no arbitrary packages or user macros).
  Acceptable for note math; may surface later as feature requests, at which point
  the MathJax and Temml trade-offs are revisited under this ADR.
- KaTeX webfonts are an extra network fetch on first math render (mitigated by
  on-demand, per-family loading and normal HTTP caching).

## Alternatives rejected

- **MathJax v3 as the engine.** Fuller LaTeX coverage, but async typesetting
  shifts layout on every keystroke in the live-preview canvas, the bundle is
  ~1 MB+, and CodeMirror integration is heavier. The extra coverage is not needed
  for note-grade math.
- **Temml → native MathML now.** Eliminates asset delivery, but 2026 MathML
  rendering is still browser- and font-dependent; too risky for the product's
  "first-class LaTeX" positioning. Kept as a future revisit (decision 6).
- **Build- or server-side pre-render.** Inapplicable to a live editor.
- **Hand-rolled typesetter.** Disproportionate; reinvents a solved problem.
- **`katex` as a `peerDependency`.** Forces consumers to know KaTeX exists and
  pin a compatible version; the coupling to `rehype-katex` makes Stylo the right
  owner of that version.
- **base64-inlining the KaTeX fonts into shipped CSS.** Adds ~1 MB and forces
  every glyph family to download whether used or not, defeating the browser's
  on-demand loading.
- **Copying / path-rewriting the woff2 files into `dist/fonts/`.** Extra build
  machinery for no gain over the `@damiro/stylo/katex.css` re-export.
