# Frontmatter as a raw callback

## Context

ADR-001 deferred exposing parsed frontmatter "to its own decision." An
integration review made the case concrete: a consumer's panel renders a
structured title / date / tags card from the leading `---` block, and Stylo could
only hand back a raw `<div>` in `preview`, or nothing at all in the editing
modes. The options were a callback with the raw text (host parses) or a bundled
key/value parser.

## Decision

Raw text, no parser — recorded as the 2026-09-04 amendment to ADR-001. Parsing
YAML is a policy the host owns (schema, date coercion, `!!` tags, multi-document
streams); a bundled parser would be the compose-don't-adopt line crossed for
frontmatter the same way ADR-001 refused it for the editing surface. A minimal
flat parser stays a possible future (revisit trigger: three consumers
hand-rolling the same one); a full YAML dependency stays rejected.

## What was built

**`onFrontmatter?: (raw: string | null) => void`** on `<Stylo>`. A `useEffect`
in `Stylo.tsx` runs `splitFrontmatter(value)` on mount and on every `value`
change, compares the inner text to a ref, and calls the handler only when it
differs — so a body-only edit does not fire it. `raw` is the text between the
fences (`""` for an empty block), or `null` when there is no block. Works in
every mode, since it is driven by `value`, not the editor view.

**`splitFrontmatter(md)`** is now re-exported from the package entry, for the
same split synchronously: `{ frontmatter, body } | null`.

Neither path parses anything. The documented pattern is
`import YAML from "yaml"; const data = YAML.parse(raw)` on the consumer side.

## Verification

`typecheck`, **297 Vitest tests** (5 new in `test/frontmatter-callback.test.tsx`
— fires once on mount, fires with `null` when absent, fires on a frontmatter
edit but not a body-only edit, fires `null` on removal, and `splitFrontmatter`
slicing), `build`, `check:theme`, `check:size`, and `format:check` pass. No new
dependency.

## Follow-ups

- A `parsed` second argument once (if) a minimal built-in parser lands.
- An in-place "properties" panel display mode — still tracked in the in-place
  canvas notes, still gated on this same no-YAML-dep line.
