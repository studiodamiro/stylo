# ADR-005 — In-place decoration toggles

- **Status:** Accepted — first slice of the customization API foreshadowed in
  [ADR-002](./2026-09-01_adr-002-editor-ux-and-customization.md); builds on the
  canvas from [ADR-004](./2026-09-01_adr-004-in-place-decoration-canvas.md)
- **Date:** 2026-09-01
- **Deciders:** damiro, Grace

## Context

The [in-place canvas](./2026-09-01_in-place-canvas.md) renders twelve Markdown
constructs live — headings, emphasis, links, wikilinks, math, list bullets, task
checkboxes, blockquotes, horizontal rules, fenced code, frontmatter, and tables.
Which of those a host actually wants is not universal: a CMS body field may want
headings and emphasis but not rendered tables; a comment box may want only
emphasis and links; a "raw notes" surface may want the reveal-on-caret behaviour
turned off for one noisy construct while keeping the rest.

[ADR-002](./2026-09-01_adr-002-editor-ux-and-customization.md) committed the
project to a developer customization API but deferred its in-place portion. This
ADR settles the **first and smallest slice**: turning individual decoration
types off, so the construct stays as plain source in the canvas.

Three questions were open:

1. **Scope.** Toggles only, or also cursor-reveal granularity, frontmatter
   display mode, and a consumer-supplied decorator hook?
2. **Shape.** Flat props on `<Stylo>`, one grouped config object, or a
   composable config builder?
3. **Extensibility.** Do consumers get an escape hatch (a declarative decorator
   hook, or raw CodeMirror extensions) in this pass?

## Decision

### 1. Scope: decoration on/off toggles only

This pass ships **only** per-type enable/disable flags. Explicitly **not** in
this slice, each deferred to its own later decision:

- `reveal: "line" | "node"` cursor-reveal granularity
  ([ADR-004](./2026-09-01_adr-004-in-place-decoration-canvas.md) deferred it).
- Frontmatter display mode (`source` / `chip` / `properties`) — the
  `properties` panel needs YAML parsing, a new dependency, and its own ADR.
- Table rendering options — inline formatting inside cells, style hooks.
- Any consumer-supplied decorator hook or CodeMirror extension pass-through.

### 2. Shape: one grouped `inPlace` prop

```tsx
<Stylo
  value={doc}
  onChange={setDoc}
  inPlace={{
    decorations: { tables: false, frontmatter: false },
  }}
/>
```

`inPlace.decorations` is a flat record of twelve optional booleans, **each
defaulting to `true`**:

| Key              | Turns off                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `headings`       | ATX heading sizing and `#` hiding                                    |
| `emphasis`       | bold / italic / strikethrough / inline-code styling                  |
| `links`          | `[text](url)` collapse to the link text                              |
| `wikilinks`      | `[[target\|label]]` collapse to the label                            |
| `math`           | `$…$` and `$$…$$` KaTeX widgets                                      |
| `lists`          | `-` / `*` / `+` bullet-glyph substitution                            |
| `tasks`          | interactive `[ ]` / `[x]` checkboxes                                 |
| `blockquote`     | left-border / muted framing, and `>` hiding off-caret                |
| `horizontalRule` | the rendered `<hr>`                                                  |
| `code`           | inline `` `code` `` styling and the fenced / indented code container |
| `frontmatter`    | the "Properties" chip over the leading YAML                          |
| `tables`         | the rendered `<table>`                                               |

Turning a key off leaves that construct exactly as it renders in `mode="source"`
— raw text, no reveal behaviour, nothing atomic.

A single object prop (not flat props, not a builder) keeps the top-level
`<Stylo>` surface small while leaving room for `inPlace.reveal`,
`inPlace.frontmatter`, and future groups to slot in beside `inPlace.decorations`
without another prop.

### 3. Mechanism: a CodeMirror facet read by every producer

The canvas has four decoration producers — the `ViewPlugin`, `blockMathField`,
`frontmatterField`, and `tableField`. A single **`Facet`**
(`inPlaceConfigFacet`) holds the resolved toggle record. `inPlaceExtension`
seeds it from the prop (`inPlaceConfigFacet.of(resolve(inPlace))`); each producer
reads `state.facet(inPlaceConfigFacet)` and returns nothing for a construct whose
key is `false`.

The three state fields stay module-level singletons — the facet, not a field
factory, carries the config — so their identities are stable and the existing
test suite (which reads `view.state.field(blockMathField)` directly) is
unaffected; with no prop supplied the facet resolves to all-`true` and behaviour
is identical to before.

### 4. Applied at construction

`InPlaceView` builds its extension array once, so the config is read when the
canvas mounts. Changing `inPlace` on an already-mounted `<Stylo>` has no effect
until the editor is recreated (e.g. via a changed React `key`). This matches how
the canvas already treats its other options and avoids a live-reconfiguration
path for a prop that is set once in practice. Revisit if a real use case for
runtime toggling appears.

> **Amended 2026-09-02:** remounting on toggle change (as the playground demo
> does) surfaced a pre-existing bug in `frontmatterField` — a fresh
> `EditorState`'s default caret sits at position 0, inside the frontmatter
> block, so the chip never rendered on the very first frame of any mount
> (including before this ADR). Fixed: the field now starts folded
> unconditionally at creation and only reveals in response to an actual
> selection change, not the construction-time default.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Hosts tailor the canvas to the field without forking or re-implementing it.
- No new dependency, no new public concept beyond one object prop.
- The facet is read at build time only; no per-keystroke cost.
- `mode="source"` and the no-prop default are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- `inPlace` is a namespace: later customization groups extend it, they don't
  add sibling props.

**Negative / costs**

- Twelve boolean keys are twelve things to document, test, and keep working as
  the canvas grows. Mitigated by every key mapping to one already-isolated
  producer branch.
- Construction-time application is a mild surprise for anyone expecting live
  prop reactivity; documented in the prop reference.
- Interacting toggles (`tasks: false` with `lists: true` on a `- [ ]` row) need
  deliberate handling in the list branch so a disabled task still falls all the
  way back to source.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Flat props on `<Stylo>`** (`inPlaceHeadings={false}`, …). Twelve-plus new
  top-level props now, more as reveal mode and frontmatter mode land. A single
  `inPlace` object namespaces the whole area.
- **A composable config builder** (`createInPlaceConfig({...})`). Extra ceremony
  and an opaque value to pass, for a config that is a plain record of booleans.
  Reconsider only if config assembly ever needs to be tree-shaken or composed
  from fragments.
- **A consumer decorator hook in this pass.** Defining "add your own in-place
  decoration" is the highest lock-in risk in the customization API; getting the
  contract wrong is expensive to walk back. It gets its own ADR once concrete
  use cases exist.
- **Field factories instead of a facet.** Making `blockMathField` &c. functions
  of the config would break their singleton identity, forcing the test suite and
  any future direct consumers to thread instances around. The facet gives the
  same result with stable identities.
- **Live reconfiguration on prop change.** A compartment-swap path for a prop
  that is set once adds moving parts for no proven need.
