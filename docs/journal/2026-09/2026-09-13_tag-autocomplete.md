# `#tag` autocomplete

## Context

Sympose wanted `#tag` autocomplete to match `[[wikilink]]` autocomplete's UX
exactly — same trigger-while-typing popup, same themed dropdown. Its own
engineering log traced why it couldn't be built from `ui/` alone: the `[[`
trigger, the completion-source registration, and the shared tooltip all live
inside Stylo's own editor factory, and there was no equivalent hook for `#`.
Filed as an upstream request; landed here as a thin prop, mirroring
`wikiLinkSource`'s shape.

## Decision

A new prop, **`tagSource`**:

```ts
type TagCompletion = { tag: string }
type TagSource = (query: string) => readonly TagCompletion[] | Promise<readonly TagCompletion[]>
```

Implemented in
[`src/editor/tag-complete.ts`](../../../src/editor/tag-complete.ts) as a
`@codemirror/autocomplete` source, wired into `baseExtensions` right after the
wikilink one so `source`, `split`, and `in-place` share it. Read once at mount,
like `wikiLinkSource`. Off entirely when the prop is absent —
`tagCompletion(undefined)` returns `[]`.

### Choices

- **No `label` field.** `WikiLinkCompletion.label` exists because
  `[[target|label]]` is real syntax; tags have no alias form, so
  `TagCompletion` stays `{ tag: string }`. Adding a field later is
  non-breaking if that ever changes.
- **Trigger:** `matchBefore(/(?<=^|\s)#[^\s#]*$/)` — `#` at the start of a line
  or after whitespace, with the tag typed so far, stopping at whitespace or a
  second `#`. The lookbehind is what wikilinks didn't need: `[[` can't collide
  with anything else in Markdown, but a bare `#` is also the ATX heading marker
  and shows up mid-word in URL fragments. Two exclusions fall out of it for
  free:
  - **Headings never trigger it.** `# Heading` requires a space after `#`
    (CommonMark), and the query segment excludes whitespace — the moment a
    space follows `#`, the match breaks before there is any heading text to
    react to. No separate heading-detection code needed.
  - **Mid-word `#` never triggers it** (`word#word`, `page.md#section`) — the
    lookbehind requires whitespace or start-of-line immediately before `#`.
- **Also skips a digit right after `#`** (`#1234`) — that reads as an issue or
  anchor reference, not a tag. This one is not free from the regex; it is a
  small explicit check, since `#1` is a syntactically valid tag start by the
  whitespace rule alone.
- **Insert:** replace the query with `tag` — no closing delimiter to manage,
  unlike `[[wikilink]]`, which has to reuse-or-append `]]`.
- **Same `autocompletion()` extension, same tooltip.** `autocompletion()`'s
  state field and facet are module-level singletons in
  `@codemirror/autocomplete`, so calling it again from `tagCompletion()` does
  not duplicate anything — it just adds another `markdownLanguage.data`
  completion source alongside the wikilink one. No new CSS: the popup was
  already unstyled (CodeMirror's own default), so tags render identically to
  wikilinks for free.

## Consequences

- One more mount-time prop. The props reference and README now list four
  (`inPlace`, `codeLanguages`, `wikiLinkSource`, `tagSource`).
- `test/tag-complete.test.ts` covers the source, the trigger exclusions, and
  the insert logic; `test/browser/tag-complete.spec.ts` drives the real popup
  in `source` and `in-place`, mirroring the wikilink spec.
- Sympose's own tag-index / prop-threading work (`tagSource` through
  `app-shell.tsx` → `markdown-panel.tsx`) is unblocked once this ships in a
  release.
