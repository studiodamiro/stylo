# Stylo Wiki

Concept-based documentation for **Stylo**, a plain-text-first Markdown editor for
React with first-class LaTeX (KaTeX) support.

## Navigation

### Architecture

- [[architecture/overview|System Overview]] — the plain-text-first model, the
  composed stack, and the render pipeline.

### Guides

- [[guides/integration|Integrating Stylo]] — which props are live vs. read at
  mount, persistence, stylesheet and peer-dependency setup, and the theming
  contract.
- [[guides/autosave|Auto-save]] — why it is not a prop, and a `useAutosave`
  hook that debounces `onChange` and flushes before the tab closes.
- [[guides/layout-and-touch|Layout and touch]] — the three page layouts, the
  full-height recipe that pins a toolbar for free, and what to expect from the
  context menu, menu sizing, and caret placement on touch.

### Reference

- [[reference/props|`<Stylo>` props]] — the current prop surface, styling tokens,
  and math setup.
- [[reference/toolbar|Formatting toolbar]] — the `toolbar` prop, command ids,
  keyboard shortcuts, and the `icons` override.
- [[reference/toolbar-settings|`<StyloToolbarSettings />`]] — the opt-in
  end-user customizer for the formatting bar.
- [[reference/in-place-config|In-place canvas configuration]] — the `inPlace`
  prop and its decoration toggles.
- [[reference/code-languages|Fenced-code highlighting]] — the `codeLanguages`
  prop and how to opt into language grammars.

## Engineering journal

Chronological milestones and Architectural Decision Records live outside the wiki,

[`docs/PROJECT_JOURNAL.md`](../PROJECT_JOURNAL.md).
