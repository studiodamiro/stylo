# Changelog

Notable changes to Stylo. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) from 1.0.0 onward.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.1] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- **`preview` had no scroll container.** In a host that gives `<Stylo>` a
  bounded height, a note longer than the visible panel was clipped by
  `.root`'s `overflow: hidden` with nothing in between to catch the overflow
  instead — `.preview` was the one surface in `stylo.module.css` missing the
  `flex: 1 1 auto; min-height: 0; overflow: auto` pattern `source` and
  `in-place` already had.
- **`readOnly` didn't stop the in-place canvas's right-click menu or floating
  selection bar from editing.** `EditorState.readOnly` only gates
  DOM-originated input (keyboard/paste/IME); it doesn't block a plain
  programmatic `view.dispatch(...)`, and the menu and selection bar's buttons
  call one unconditionally. Both now check `view.state.readOnly` — the menu
  no longer opens (the browser's own context menu shows instead, same as
  today's `contextMenu: false`), and the selection bar no longer appears —
  and both react to a live `readOnly` change with no remount needed.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- **`preview` (and `split`'s preview pane) syntax-highlight fenced code.**
  Pass the same `codeLanguages` prop already used for `source` / `split` /
  `in-place`; a fence's language resolves the same way and is coloured with
  the same `--stylo-syntax-*` tokens the in-place canvas already reads, so a
  block looks identical read or edited. Opt-in, like `codeLanguages` always
  was — omit it and fenced code stays plain text, today's behaviour. No new
  dependency.

### Changed

- **`preview`'s base typography now tracks `--stylo-font-size`** instead of a
  hardcoded `0.9375rem`. Its whole reading scale (headings, lists, code,
  spacing) is `em`-based off that one value, so a host that has already set
  `--stylo-font-size` for the in-place canvas gets a matching `preview` size
  instead of a second, independently-sized scale. Visual change for any
  consumer that overrides `--stylo-font-size` away from the default — no
  change for anyone still on the default.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- **`tagSource`** — a prop that turns on `#tag` autocomplete on the CodeMirror
  surfaces (`source`, `split`, `in-place`), mirroring `wikiLinkSource`'s
  contract exactly. It takes `(query: string) => TagCompletion[] | Promise<…>`,
  where `TagCompletion` is `{ tag: string }`; the host owns the index and the
  ordering, Stylo owns the trigger and the insert. The trigger only fires on a
  `#` at the start of a line or after whitespace, and never on a `# Heading`
  marker (the space after `#` breaks the match before any heading text is
  typed) or mid-word (`word#word`, a URL fragment); it also skips a `#`
  immediately followed by a digit (`#1234`, an issue or anchor reference).
  Registered alongside the wikilink source through the same Markdown-language
  completion machinery, so it shares the same tooltip and is inert in fenced
  code. Off unless the prop is passed; read once, at mount.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- **`canvasHeader` prop.** Dock host content — a frontmatter card, say —
  inside the editing surface itself, after the find/replace panel and
  before the document body. `toolbar.render` can't reach this seam: it
  wraps content before the whole canvas, while the search panel is
  CodeMirror's own internal top panel. Built on the same `showPanel`
  mechanism as the search panel, ordered to dock under it. Available on
  `source`, `in-place`, and `split`'s source pane; never `preview`.

### Changed

- **The formatting bar wraps by group, not mid-group.** It already wrapped
  onto multiple lines on a narrow host; now each `"|"`-delimited run of
  buttons wraps as one unit, using the grouping a consumer's `items` array
  already expresses — no new config.
- **`search` shows pressed while the find/replace panel is open**, like
  every other toggle button.

### Fixed

- **The caret could land back inside a table when arrowing or tabbing out
  of its last cell**, if the table was followed with no blank line by
  plain text — GFM swallows that line into the table, and the editable
  table widget's own range calculation disagreed with the real parse.
- **Clicking below a `![[ref]]` embed could misplace the caret.** The
  embed's vertical spacing used `margin`, which sits outside the box
  CodeMirror measures for click-to-position — the same bug class fixed for
  every other block. Interactive content inside a resolved embed (a
  button, say) now reliably keeps its own clicks too, through the
  technique the editable table widget already used for the same problem.
- **A self-styled embed card's accent rail could sit apart from the
  card**, if the card had its own margin — it used to collapse straight
  through stylo's wrapper.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **Find/replace panel's Tab order now matches its layout.** 0.10.0's
  single-line panel was still `@codemirror/search`'s default markup
  reordered from outside with CSS `order`, so Tab followed the library's
  internal field order regardless of the new visual layout. The panel is
  now built directly through the `search()` extension's `createPanel` hook
  in the order it reads — find, next/prev/all, replace, replace/replace
  all, then match case/regexp/by word and close — so Tab order matches the
  screen by construction. Closing (the panel's × button and `Escape`) now
  animates via a plain listener on stylo's own elements instead of
  intercepting the library's click/keydown in the capture phase.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-12

### Changed

- **Find/replace panel is one toolbar-height row.** `@codemirror/search`'s
  fixed panel markup (find field, next/previous/all, three checkboxes, then
  the replace row) is reordered with flex `order` onto a single line — find,
  next/previous/all, replace, replace/replace all, then match
  case/regexp/by word — with borderless buttons matching the main toolbar's
  own, so it reads as one more row of the toolbar rather than a separate
  floating panel. Tab order still follows the library's underlying DOM
  order, not the new visual layout.
- **The panel slides open and closed.** The toolbar's "search" command now
  toggles the panel instead of only opening it, and both the panel's own ×
  button and `Escape` animate it shut instead of removing it instantly.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-09-11

No code changes — docs and test coverage only.

### Changed

- **README's "Why" section names the actual alternatives** (TipTap, Milkdown,
  BlockNote, Lexical, Toast UI Editor, EasyMDE/SimpleMDE, raw CodeMirror 6) and
  why round-trip fidelity rules each one out, instead of gesturing at
  "ProseMirror/Lexical" generically.
- **`wikiLinkSource` / `embedSource` mount-time docs** now warn against a `key`
  remount when their backing data changes often (a note index, a file tree) —
  it drops cursor position, undo history, and scroll — and show the
  ref-plus-stable-`useCallback` pattern instead. See
  [props · applied at mount](docs/wiki/reference/props.md#config-applied-at-mount).
- **Auto-save guide sketches conflict detection** (a version stamp checked
  before write) as a possible host-layer approach, without adding any API for
  it — persistence policy stays the app's call. See the
  [Auto-save guide](docs/wiki/guides/autosave.md).

### Added

- A permanent Vitest round-trip fixture (`test/round-trip.test.tsx`) —
  frontmatter, both wikilink forms, an embed reference, inline and block math,
  a table, fenced code, a thematic break, and a callout — asserting the live
  document comes back unchanged on both `source` and `in-place` mode. The only
  prior verification for this property was a scratch-and-delete Playwright
  pass.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- **`![[ref]]` transclusion on the in-place canvas.** `embedSource` now resolves
  embeds on all three surfaces, not just `preview` / `split`. An off-caret
  lone-line `![[ref]]` renders as a block: `EmbedWidget` contributes an inert
  slot element, and `InPlaceView` portals the same `<Embed>` component used by
  `preview` into every live slot through a small `EmbedRegistry` +
  `useSyncExternalStore` bridge — one React tree, so the async path, the
  `![[ref]]` fallbacks, Suspense, and error boundaries all carry over. Put the
  caret on the line to reveal the raw source; interactive host content keeps its
  own clicks. New `inPlace={{ decorations: { embeds: false } }}` toggle. On the
  canvas `embedSource` is read once at mount, like `wikiLinkSource`. See
  [ADR-009](docs/journal/2026-09/2026-09-11_adr-009-react-nodes-in-the-in-place-canvas.md).
- New style hook `.cm-inplace-embed` (the canvas slot); `.stylo-embed-content`
  and `--stylo-embed-accent` are shared with the `preview` embed.

- **Inline `![[ref]]` embeds.** A `![[ref]]` mid-sentence now renders as inline
  phrasing content flowing with the text, on `preview`, `split`, and the
  in-place canvas — previously only a `![[ref]]` alone on its line was an embed.
  Return phrasing content (not a block element) for these; `![[…]]` inside code
  stays literal. New style hooks `.stylo-embed-inline` (preview / split) and
  `.cm-inplace-embed-inline` (canvas).

- **`![[ref]]` in an in-place table cell renders literally** rather than as a
  misleading `!` + wikilink chip. That surface is for editing tabular text;
  `preview` / `split` transclude in cells as normal. Also fixes a stray
  overlapping embed decoration on table lines introduced with inline embeds.

- **`onResolveError`** — an optional callback fired when `embedSource` or
  `wikiLinkSource` throws or returns a rejected promise. `(error, info)` where
  `info` is `{ source: "embedSource" | "wikiLinkSource"; input: string }`. Pure
  observation: the resolver still falls back (literal `![[ref]]` text, or no
  completions), and a `null` return is not treated as an error. Reactive. The
  exported type is `ResolveErrorInfo`.

- **`![[ref]]` resolution is cached.** A shared, per-`embedSource` cache keyed by
  `ref` means an embed scrolled out of the in-place canvas and back — or
  re-mounted by a `preview` re-render — is served without re-invoking
  `embedSource`, and with no loading flash. In-flight requests for the same
  `ref` are deduplicated; rejections are not cached; the cache is capped at 64
  references per resolver. Content is now memoised by `ref`: vary the `ref` or
  pass a new `embedSource` if a reference's content can change.

### Changed

- **`inPlace.reveal: "never"` — a fenced code block no longer shows its ` ``` `
  fences when the caret is inside it.** The block's body stays plain editable
  source; the language is set through the right-click **Language** field and
  **Remove code block** unwraps it, so the fences had no editing role left. A
  body-less block (` ``` ` / ` ``` ` with nothing between) still reveals its
  fences on caret entry, as the only way to see or delete it. No effect under
  the default `reveal: "caret"`.

- **`inPlace.reveal: "never"` — a `---` / `***` thematic break no longer shows
  its source when the caret is on it.** The rendered `<hr>` stays put; to remove
  the rule, press Backspace or Delete on the line, or right-click it for
  **Remove divider**. Clicking the rule places the caret on it, so Backspace
  works straight after. No effect under the default `reveal: "caret"`.

- **`inPlace.reveal: "never"` — inline `$…$` / one-line `$$…$$` math no longer
  shows its LaTeX when the caret is on it.** Instead: a right-click **Math**
  field edits the source in place (prefilled, with **Remove math**, when the
  caret sits in an existing span); clicking a rendered widget opens the same
  field at the pointer; hovering one shows the raw LaTeX in a tooltip. A
  multi-line `$$` block is unaffected — it keeps its existing caret-reveal. No
  effect under the default `reveal: "caret"`.

### Fixed

- With `embedSource` set, a lone `![[ref]]` on the in-place canvas no longer
  renders as a stray `!` followed by a `[[ref]]` link chip — the wikilink pass
  yields the inner `[[ref]]` to the embed pass.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **`embedSource`** — a prop that resolves `![[ref]]` transclusion in `preview`
  and `split`. It takes `(ref: string) => ReactNode | Promise<ReactNode>`; Stylo
  has no vault, so it detects the `![[…]]` and renders whatever node the host
  returns in its place. The reference is passed verbatim, `#heading` /
  `#^blockid` / `|size` suffixes intact (in an embed `|` is a size hint, not a
  label, so `WIKILINK_PATTERN` is not reused). While the resolver is pending, and
  if it rejects or returns `null`, the literal `![[ref]]` text stands in.
  Recognised only when the `![[…]]` is alone on its line — an inline `![[…]]`
  stays literal to avoid nesting a host `<div>` inside a `<p>`. Off unless the
  prop is passed; the in-place canvas is unaffected for now. Renders into
  `<div class="stylo-embed"><div class="stylo-embed-content">`, with a
  `--stylo-embed-accent` variable. No new dependency.

### Fixed

- **`split` now honours `frontmatter`.** `SplitView` accepted the prop but never
  passed it to its preview pane, so `frontmatter="code"` did nothing in `split`
  mode (it worked in `preview`). The pane now renders the
  `<div class="stylo-frontmatter">` block like `preview` does.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **`wikiLinkSource`** — a prop that turns on `[[wikilink]]` autocomplete on the
  CodeMirror surfaces (`source`, `split`, `in-place`). It takes
  `(query: string) => WikiLinkCompletion[] | Promise<…>`, where
  `WikiLinkCompletion` is `{ target: string; label?: string }`; the host owns the
  index and the ordering, Stylo owns the trigger (an unclosed `[[…`) and the
  insert. Accepting writes `[[target]]`, or `[[target|label]]` when a candidate's
  `label` differs, reusing a `]]` the user already typed. Registered as a
  Markdown-language completion source, so it is inert in fenced code. Off unless
  the prop is passed; read once, at mount. `@codemirror/autocomplete` becomes a
  regular dependency (already transitive via `@codemirror/lang-markdown`,
  externalised from the bundle). `![[embed]]` transclusion is still out of scope.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **`--stylo-font-family` and `--stylo-font-family-mono`** — the prose and code
  font stacks, previously hard-coded. `--stylo-font-family` backs the in-place
  canvas, the "Frontmatter" labels, and the fixed-position sticky toolbar;
  `--stylo-font-family-mono` backs source mode, the in-place code decorations,
  and preview `code` / `pre`. Defaults are the stacks that were inline, so no
  visual change out of the box. Not colours — one value each, light block only,
  like `--stylo-radius` / `--stylo-font-size`. The `preview` prose surface still
  inherits its font from the host by design.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **`--stylo-font-size`** — a tenth styling token (default `0.9375rem`) that
  sets the base editor font size. `.cm-editor` previously hard-coded it, so a
  host wanting the editor at its own type scale had to override an internal
  CodeMirror class outside the `--stylo-*` contract. The token backs that rule
  on every surface; the in-place canvas is sized in `em`, so the whole surface
  scales from it. Like `--stylo-radius` it is not a colour — one value serves
  both themes.

### Fixed

- The in-place selection bar (`selectionUI: "bar"`) and the right-click context
  menu are separate floating layers at the same `z-index` and had no awareness
  of each other, so opening the menu left it stacked over the bar. The bar now
  yields while the menu is open and returns when it closes.

### Documentation

- README gains a **Features** list, a **Documentation** map into the wiki, a
  screenshot of the in-place canvas, and an `npm install @damiro/stylo` line in
  place of the pre-publish git instructions.
- New wiki guide, **Integrating Stylo** (`docs/wiki/guides/integration.md`):
  controlled-component contract, live vs. mount-time props, persistence,
  stylesheet and peer-dependency setup, `getView()`, and the theming rules.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **`<StyloToolbarSettings />`** — an opt-in component, exported from
  `@damiro/stylo/toolbar-settings`, that lets an end user rearrange the
  formatting bar. Controlled: `value` is the same `items` array passed to
  `<Stylo toolbar={{ items }}>`, `onChange` fires on every edit, and the host
  owns persistence. Two lists, "On the bar" and "Available": **drag a row's ⠿
  handle to reorder** (pointer, or focus the handle and use Space + Arrow keys —
  `@dnd-kit`'s keyboard sensor, with screen-reader announcements); the ✕ / Add
  buttons move items between the lists; "Add separator" and "Reset to default"
  below. `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, and `@dnd-kit/utilities` are
  **optional** peer dependencies of this entry — a plain `@damiro/stylo` import
  never pulls them, and they are externalised from the bundle. Completes the
  ADR-002 §2 customizer.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **Find / replace.** `@codemirror/search` is wired into every editing surface
  (`source`, `split`, `in-place`); `preview` has no editor, so it is unaffected.
  `Mod-f` opens the panel whether or not the visible toolbar is mounted;
  `Mod-g` / `Mod-Shift-g` step matches, `Mod-Alt-g` replaces, `Escape` closes.
  The panel docks at the top and is restyled to Stylo's flat, token-driven
  chrome. A new opt-in `search` toolbar command id (like `save` / `underline`,
  not in the default bar) opens the same panel. `@codemirror/search` is a
  regular dependency — auto-installed for the consumer — but externalised from
  the bundle like the other `@codemirror/*` packages, so npm dedupe keeps a
  single CodeMirror instance. ADR-002 §2 amendment.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-10

Carries the CodeMirror peer-dependency change, so it is a minor bump under the
pre-1.0 "anything may still change" rule rather than a patch. Cut and tagged;
the first npm-registry publish is deferred to a later version.

### Added

- `--stylo-surface-floating` token — background for the floating in-place popups
  (the context menu, its URL input, the selection bar, the link-hover tooltip).
  A concrete colour with light and dark values, **not** an alias of
  `--stylo-bg`: a host that sets `--stylo-bg: transparent` to drop the editor
  into an existing card now keeps those popups opaque and legible instead of
  seeing them blend into the content behind. Override it for a raised or tinted
  popup surface. ADR-002 §3 amendment.
- Thin, token-tinted scrollbars on the editing surface (`.cm-scroller`), so
  `source`, `in-place`, and the source pane of `split` no longer fall back to a
  heavier native scrollbar than the chrome around them. Driven by
  `--stylo-border` / `--stylo-text-muted`; a host's own `.cm-scroller` rules
  load after and win.
- Toolbar extensibility. `toolbar.items` now accepts `ToolbarCustomItem` objects
  (`{ id, title, icon, run, isActive?, disabled? }`) mixed in with the built-in
  ids — a consumer's own button, run against the live view, refreshed on the
  same events as the built-ins. New `toolbar.render` slot wraps or replaces the
  rendered bar. Every toolbar button now carries a `data-command="<id>"`
  attribute. Custom items have no keyboard-shortcut field yet — bind against
  `getView()`. ADR-002 §2 amendment.
- `underline` toolbar command — wraps the selection in a raw `<u>…</u>` HTML
  pair (Markdown has no underline), bound to `Mod-u`. Not in the default bar;
  add `"underline"` to `toolbar.items` to show the button. Renders underlined
  wherever the host renders inline HTML; Stylo's bundled `preview` does not.
- Touch support for the in-place context menu. A long-press (≈450 ms) opens the
  canvas menu and the editable table's structural menu where a mouse would
  right-click; a tap outside dismisses it. The table's edge `+` add-row /
  add-column strips stay visible on touch devices instead of only on hover.
  Refined after an on-device pass — see **Fixed** and **Changed** below. ADR-007
  rollout log; ADR-002 §2 amendment (2026-09-09).
- The in-place context menu grows for touch under `@media (pointer: coarse)` —
  menu rows and the URL input take a wider vertical gutter (~18&nbsp;px between
  labels), the selection bar a 44&nbsp;px tap target. Automatic, no prop —
  resizing an existing popup changes no layout, unlike `toolbar.sticky`, which
  stays opt-in. Override through the `.cm-inplace-*` classes. ADR-002 §2
  amendment.
- `toolbar={{ sticky: "bottom" | "top" | true }}` — pins the formatting bar to
  an edge instead of wherever `<Stylo>` sits on the page (`true` is an alias
  for `"bottom"`). Both are `position: fixed`. `"bottom"` rides above the
  on-screen keyboard (the Obsidian / iA Writer mobile pattern) — pair it with
  `interactive-widget=resizes-content` on your page's `<meta name="viewport">`
  for the most reliable tracking, and note it can render behind a platform's
  own keyboard accessory bar (native chrome, outside any web z-index). `"top"`
  needs neither: nothing eats into the top of the screen, so it can't collide
  with a keyboard or its accessory bar. It runs a `requestAnimationFrame` loop
  that continuously re-asserts its position rather than setting it once — see
  **Known limitations** below for what that does and doesn't cover on iOS
  Safari. Off by default; combine with your own responsive check if you only
  want it below a breakpoint. New `stickyVisibility` prop (`"consistent"`, the
  default, or `"dynamic"`) fades the bar out while the editing surface is
  unfocused. ADR-002 §2 amendment.

### Documentation

- The `inPlace` and `codeLanguages` props are now specified as **applied at
  mount** — a deliberate contract, with the `key`-to-remount recipe and the
  reasons a live-reconfiguration path was rejected. ADR-005 config-lifecycle
  amendment; props and in-place-config references.
- The README and the fenced-code reference now state up front that fenced code
  renders in flat, uncoloured monospace until `codeLanguages` is passed —
  previously only discoverable by reading the reference in full.
- New guide, [Layout and touch](docs/wiki/guides/layout-and-touch.md): the
  three page layouts (inline, full height, bounded box), the full-height recipe
  that pins a toolbar with no `position: fixed`, and what to expect from the
  context menu, menu sizing, and caret placement on touch.

### Changed

- The in-place context menu's active row now takes its accent from
  `--stylo-accent` (documented role: active / pressed states) instead of
  `--stylo-ring`. `--stylo-ring` is the focus ring only now, so a host can drop
  or restyle the focus outline without also recolouring the menu. ADR-002 §3
  amendment.
- **BREAKING:** `@codemirror/*` and `@lezer/common` / `@lezer/highlight` are now
  `peerDependencies` rather than bundled dependencies, and are externalised from
  the build (ADR-008). The host installs one copy of CodeMirror and Stylo shares
  it, so `EditorState`, facets, and the syntax tree keep a single identity
  across the host and the editor — `getView()`, extra extensions, and host-side
  `syntaxTree` reads all line up. Install the packages alongside Stylo; see the
  README. Drops roughly 190&nbsp;kB gzipped from the bundle, and the `dist/`
  `codemirror` chunk with it.
- Long-press tuning for the in-place menu: abort `slop` 10&nbsp;px → 20&nbsp;px
  (a fingertip cannot hold to 10&nbsp;px for half a second), hold `delay`
  500&nbsp;ms → 450&nbsp;ms. `.cm-content` now sets `-webkit-touch-callout: none`
  so iOS Safari's own long-press callout stops racing — and usually beating —
  the gesture. Text selection and the selection handles are unaffected. Still
  fiddly to land on iOS after these changes; `inPlace.selectionUI: "bar"` is the
  recommended touch trigger. ADR-002 §2 amendment.

### Fixed

- The in-place context menu no longer dismisses itself the instant it opens on
  touch. `armDismiss` now ignores `scroll` for 350&nbsp;ms after the menu
  appears — a long-press is one continuous gesture that routinely emits an
  incidental scroll (iOS's own long-press handling, a hair of finger drift, a
  focus-driven viewport shift) in the frames right after it opens. A deliberate
  scroll-away lands well after the window and still dismisses as before.

### Known limitations

- `toolbar.sticky` (`"top"` and `"bottom"`) can disappear for the duration of
  an active scroll gesture on iOS Safari, reappearing once scrolling settles.
  Investigated at length — a compositing hint, real `position: sticky`, and a
  `requestAnimationFrame` watchdog each closed one trigger and left this one
  standing, including against a bare, unrelated element given the same
  watchdog as a control. iOS Safari is known to drop `position: fixed` layers
  from active compositing during a scroll gesture as a performance
  optimisation, independent of any page CSS or JS — there is no available
  fix from web content, the same class of limitation as `"bottom"`'s
  accessory-bar collision. For a formatting surface that must survive being
  actively scrolled, `inPlace.selectionUI: "bar"` positions relative to the
  selection instead of the window and doesn't have this problem. ADR-002 §2
  amendment.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-04

First versioned, installable release. Marks the point the library became
consumable from git.

### Added

- `<Stylo>` with four modes: `in-place` (default live decoration canvas),
  `source`, `preview`, `split`.
- In-place canvas: caret-reveal and always-hidden marker modes, right-click
  context menu, floating selection bar, autoformat-on-type, interactive table
  editing, callouts, and per-construct decoration toggles.
- Formatting toolbar with configurable, orderable built-in commands and
  per-command icon overrides via the `icons` prop.
- `[[wikilink]]` support with an `onWikiLinkClick` callback; `onLinkClick` for
  standard links.
- `onFrontmatter(raw)` callback (fires on mount and on change) and a
  `splitFrontmatter(md)` export. Stylo bundles no YAML parser — the host parses
  the raw block.
- `onSave` prop: `Mod-s` on any editing surface calls it with the full document
  and suppresses the browser's save dialog. An opt-in `save` toolbar id runs the
  same path; it is not in the default bar and stays disabled until `onSave` is
  wired. Auto-save stays a consumer concern — see the wiki guide.
- Imperative handle on a `ref` to `<Stylo>` — `focus()`, `scrollToHeading()`,
  `insertAtCursor()`, and `getView()` for direct `EditorView` access.
- Dark palette in `tokens.css`, triggered by a `.dark` / `[data-theme="dark"]`
  ancestor; `color-scheme` set on both themes.
- KaTeX rendering for `$…$` and `$$…$$`; the stylesheet ships separately as
  `@damiro/stylo/katex.css`.
- Opt-in fenced-code syntax highlighting via `codeLanguages`.
- `--stylo-*` CSS custom properties for theming, light and dark.
- `prepare` script, so the bundle builds itself on `npm install` from git.
- `manualChunks` so the built vendor chunks are named `codemirror`, `markdown`,
  and `katex` rather than after arbitrary internal modules.
- CI guards: `check:theme` (every `--stylo-*` colour has a light and a dark
  value) and `check:size` (per-chunk gzip budgets). CI also runs a React 18 and
  a TypeScript 6 job against the peer/consumer floor.

### Known limitations

- No built-in YAML parsing or rendered "properties" panel; `onFrontmatter` hands
  over the raw block and the host parses it.
- `@codemirror/*` are regular dependencies, not peer dependencies.
- The test suite runs in jsdom only.
- `inPlace` config is read once at mount; changing it needs a remount. (Now
  documented as an intentional contract — see `[Unreleased]`.)
